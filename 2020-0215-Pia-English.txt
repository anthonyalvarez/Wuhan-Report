1. From the end of December 2019 to the spring of 2020, the Chinese people are facing one of the most serious dangers, and the outbreak of New Coronary Pneumonia in Wuhan is so severe that everyone is afraid! Self-confessed that he is not a brave person, but at least I can tell the truth, do not escape, face the problem. At the same time encourage those who tell the truth and form a force with them. When we are paying for society, we are not afraid of ridicule, not afraid of some people say we are "impulsive, excessive". We are not cowardly, we are people of conscience!

4. The Story of Woolende
International epidemic prevention expert Meisni visited the plague patient sitd out the plague patient died. Epidemic prevention experts killed the entire city of Harbin, a Russian hospital. The Qing government ordered the city to be sealed and the whole city to catch rats, causing the world to shock. Woolendard's judgment was confirmed in such a way. Many of Woolende's proposed initiatives have been actively supported and implemented by the government, and public health has attracted the attention of all levels of government for the first time.
Cao Bingwei, a scholar of modern history, said:
"The Jilin Province issued a notice: the customs and quarantine sub-offices in the city set up machine potions, see people disinfection. In Tieling government to the local people sent more than 10,000 "breathing bags", ordered the people to bring breathing bags, by the patrol at any time to check, if there is non-compliance with the crime of police. Slaughter industry must be disinfected once a day, internal organs must be cleaned on the spot, packed in a special board box, not allowed to be exposed. Staff must wear white clothing.
Tianjin Health Bureau issued an emergency notice listed: drink inglias, eat cooked food, pay attention to life and hygiene and so on more than 10 preventive measures.
Beijing issued a notice: all streets and alleys shaved head houses are all paste clean, underground are padded lime, all the shop friends, clothes, cloth, handkerchiefs and so on, updated three times a day, such as found drowning, not comply with public health fines 5-30 yuan. "
Nearly a century on, even from today's perspective, these epidemic prevention measures are scientific. But to The bewilderment of Woolende is that the epidemic has not only not been contained but intensified after various epidemic prevention measures have been fully implemented. Isolation, disinfection, blocking traffic, can do things, why the outbreak is heavy day by day? At this point, Woolende is under a lot of pressure. At one point, he pondered whether there were loopholes in the defensive system he had built, and what else he had not considered?
One day he was in front of a scene of hell on earth, long standing, he saw the real hell, corpses across the wild, a row of coffins body open-air parking, stretching for a mile. It was this scene of hell in the world that made him think too hard to answer, and the bodies must be disposed of as soon as possible. Woolende first came to the burial team to let them quickly dig a hole to bury the body.
Liu Changhao, a scholar of modern history at the Beijing University School of Information Training, said:
"Harbin's winter, the temperature at least minus 20 degrees Celsius, in such a temperature the land is harder than gold stone, don't say dig a hole, that is, want to dig a shallow pit is also very difficult, so to say that the burial can only wait until the spring when the earth thawed, but in this way, I am afraid that the people who died of plague will have to multiply. "
Woolende secretly thought that there were only two ways to stop the spread of plague through the carcass: one was buried deep, the other was to burn the body. The thought flashed through Woolende's mind, and he could not shake it self. "Burning the corpse" Woolende was shocked by his thoughts and sweated. The Chinese have always had the custom of being in the land for security, and treated the remains of their parents' ancestors with greater respect. Under the traditional concept, burning corpses is simply unthinkable. Even Mr Woolende, who grew up overseas, was afraid to challenge Chinese ethics. He thought of wanting to go, but only the book court asked the emperor to go under a holy will in order to calm the opposition of the people.
Regent Wang Zhai was furious when he saw the medal: "What?" Don't you want me to make a special holy order for burning the body, isn't it to laugh at the world? Shi Zhaoji Road: "The court thought it was the work in the autumn, open a generation of the atmosphere first, the move of the world." Regent King in this critical moment, if can be when the machine to stand up, force to pull the momentum, will become my Great Qing Zhongxing King. "
Woolende's request to burn the body was so shaken by the Qing government that three days later they received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "Dr. Wu's request may be carried out according to the plan." "If the large-scale epidemic of plague and the fight against the epidemic had greatly affected the old customs of life at that time, there was no more impact than funeral savement. Cremation this new way of burial is both convenient and hygienic, its appearance is people in the funeral view of scientific and civilized concept to overcome ignorance and superstition signs. At this time, FuJiadian has been a quarter of the death of plague, coincides with the Spring Festival, in order to be able to dispel people's sad mood, cheer up everyone's spirit, the Ministry of Epidemic Prevention issued leaflets calling on everyone to set off firecrackers, flush with the anger. Strangely enough, the death toll from Fujiadian's ever-rising death toll has fallen since then.
At 0:00 p.m. on march 1, 1911, all the people in Harbin's epidemic prevention bureau held their breath and waited for the moment to come. The hour-time fingertip refers to the death toll of Fu Jiadian by 0:00 a.m. Then Changchun, Fengtian, Tieling, the major cities in the northeast have come to the newspaper, died of plague zero. The success of epidemic prevention in the three eastern provinces, so that the general commander of epidemic prevention, Wu Liande, the work of epidemic prevention to become the 12 national experts in Fengtian held a seminar on the plague of all nations. The famous Japanese scholar Kiti Chai Sanro, who discovered the plague bacteria, could only surrender to the vice-chairman. After the meeting, the Qing Dynasty rewarded Wu Liande medical officer, the army blue army rank, in the Forbidden City was summoned by the Regent, awarded the second-class Shuanglong Medal, the Governor-General awarded the Gold Award, the Tsar government awarded the second-class medal, the French government awarded the honorary title.
Liu Changhao, a scholar of modern history at the Beijing University School of Information Training, said:
"The plague that has ravaged Harbin for half a year is completely contained by Chinese of its own strength, and in the face of the great plague, the Qing government's open attitude and decisive action have made the world look great; Not only to promote China's public health care in the modern journey, but also to further curb the expansion of the Japanese and Russian aggressors' expansionary ambitions. "
In human history, the plague epidemic killed millions, and even at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, when science progressed, more than 60,000 people were just the weekly deaths during the plague epidemic in India. From this point of view, we know why Chinese and foreign people are not stingy to give the highest praise to Woolende. Just as many people were celebrating with the crown, he was already world-renowned and coolly thought the plague would make a comeback.
In 1911, the Home Office of the House of Representatives, Prince Shang Shusu, intended to set up a Special Health Department for Woolityand in the House of Affairs to manage medical care throughout China. "Although the plague in the northeast is under control, there is a possibility of a comeback, i want to establish an epidemic prevention network in the northeast, " Woolende said. Wu Liande resigned from the high-ranking Official Houlu and the invitation of various countries, he quietly returned to Harbin, the establishment of the north-east plague prevention system, and then there to stick to.
Will the plague come back? How long will it take? A year? Two years? Ten years? Or a lifetime? Will the plague reappear as he predicted? Sure enough, in 1920, the plague came again, and his hero's association, to pull the strings, once again made outstanding contributions to society; Not everyone has the opportunity to contribute their most precious decade to the country for the people. This decade, Woolende several times resigned from the national health director of the senior officials, willing to do Harbin epidemic prevention department under a small director. In the second out of the mountains, Qijia ruled the country after the world and then returned to the field, become the Nanshan mule, Qiujiang fishing father, the end of his life. Its charm of human nature is worthy of the first national soldier in the modern history of China!
"The only competitor to the human race for the dominance of the earth is the virus. "This is a somewhat surprising statement from Lealdborg, the winner of the Bell Prize, and almost all the truth behind the plague is a surprise, and Woolende's research has also uncovered the true source of the plague in the Northeast. The epidemic of plague in Northeast China has a broad international background, and the demand for animal fur in the world market at the beginning of the 20th century was the driving factor for the first large-scale plague disaster in Northeast China. The source of the plague was not a mouse but a rodent called the slug, which had been hunted in a wild hunt in a meadow on the Sino-Russian border. Over the past few years, dry fur products popular in Europe and the United States, is regarded as comparable to the fur clothing. Driven by the windfall, tens of millions of Manchurians live on the hunt for a drought, while eating from the meat. The plague virus was thus first transmitted to these hunters by the diseased slugs. Although the plague gradually became history, and its aftertones did not end, in 2003 SARS also because of the human over-invasion of nature, from the drought to the fruit beaver, the same atypical lung infectious disease, also adopted the Woolende approach. The 7,296 people who were infected in the protest, known as sars, were infected, but only 526 died. It confirms the progress of this country and all mankind, but with the northeast plague is no different is that these catastrophes for us to provide is a reflection angle, this angle is ancient, long-lasting, that is, how human beings and nature get along!
Dr. Woolende is an internationally recognized founder of public health, a well-known preventive medicine physician, medical educator and social activist. This year marks the 100th anniversary of Dr. Woolende's death, and today Harbin Medical University held the 100th anniversary of Dr. Wuliande's death and the 50th anniversary of his death.

"The content of Professor Shang Shengsheng of Wuhan University in the Circle of Friends tonight"
With consent, forward as follows:
An important visit I received during the delay of the Wuhan outbreak
       January 9, 2020 is a Thursday, I finished the First Cadre Training Class in the Yangdynast New Year, the time is already 5:30 pm. I hurried to wudda union on the 3rd floor of the staff table tennis room, want to seize the closed room before the last hour to practice.
       Just took off the thick down jacket, took out the racket standing at the table, a phone call came, I look at the main station Central Guanghubei reporter station director zuo Afu's phone, I immediately asked the left stationmaster what is the matter, he said there is an interview to listen to expert advice, about the newly discovered infectious disease in Wuhan City.
       I felt like it was a big deal, put on my clothes and walk out of the room. I said, Wuhan City is now having two meetings, your interview should not be allowed to send it, he said, yes, but we are now writing an internal reference.
       I asked, what the hell is going on now? Left stationmaster said: This infectious disease is very serious, we have interviewed several patients, one of whom is a young man working in Wuhan, this worker to see the disease has spent the past few years to earn 90,000 yuan, has not been diagnosed. The hospital told him to prepare 200,000, he said there is no money, also can not borrow, he had to go out and wait.
      The question for the left stationmaster is, such an infectious disease is terrible, is it our emergency management department responsible for hurrying out to do something? For example, patients who look down on the disease, give relief to some of the cost of examination and treatment? I told him that this was a real public health incident and that government departments had to initiate procedures for crisis management.
       I told him, first, that everyone is an integral part of this society, and that his illness and misfortune are closely related to others and society. The uncaring worker walking out of the hospital can infect others or act anti-socially because of despair. Because despair is more terrible than poverty.
       Second, there are two iron principles that crisis management must follow. One is the golden hour principle, which is that it is important to begin disposal in the initial state of a crisis event. Because over time, things evolve, crisis events will lead to more crisis events, thus forming a "crisis incident group." It's getting harder and more costly to deal with. The second is to reach the crisis scene principle. That is, in the event of a crisis, all the "relevant departments" in charge must arrive at the scene as soon as possible, regardless of the level. Because to the scene and in the office to listen to the report, is a completely different feeling and cognition. Any reports you hear in the office are inevitably filtered and distorted.
       Therefore, I told the left stationmaster, Wuhan City party and government leaders and the newly formed head of the Emergency Management Bureau, should be highly vigilant, follow the scientific regulationofs of crisis management, hasten to deal with the South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Hankou has been a month of coronavirus pneumonia incident. Disposition includes, organizational coordination and mobilization of resources to deal with, for patients infected with the disease should be completely free, inform hospitals, do not talk about money, first treatment, of course, including the media response to the problem. Media responses include how the news media respondtoes to crisis events and how government departments use and respond to the news media.
      Finally, I told the left stationmaster, I talked for nearly an hour, a lot of content, you sum it up. Because as an in-house draft, there should be a more realistic narrative, presentation, and actionable constructive opinion.
       I don't know.
      Unfortunately, what shouldnot have happened after January 9, 2020, has happened.
      I think, the left station master's internal reference, either the leader did not see, or saw, ignored. Or because we're soft-spoken.
     In Wuhan city has been 24 days and i don't know how to unseal today, in this snowy afternoon like remembering the dead, including me and my family, Wuhan 9 million people stay home for a long time, I recorded this interview here, both to comfort their conscience, but also to tell the world, Hubei and Wuhan certainly exist, Many of the many people who respect common sense and science, those who are in awe of life and have a conscience to speak! Now, as people in the "epidemic area", our unfortunate experience, but also outside the epidemic area of all of you unfortunate part, please do more to treat Hubei people Wuhan people!
       Also, moved, salute, hold up, refueling words, I must later say specifically.

7. Chang Kai, want to cry and tears to you away from the road
Yesterday, Hubei Film Studio Chang Kai (born in 1964) died of new crown pneumonia, and now see his classmates write a tribute, not to mention, sad to see, from the memorial is not difficult to see the severity of the epidemic, for the intensity of the harm! It can also be seen the current situation of the sick people in Wuhan in the outbreak.
All night is dizzy, turn over and over hard to sleep. Maybe last night's lightning flashed to stop your path to heaven? Today's sad wind bitter rain is to use the cold to remind you to wear more clothes, your path to heaven people cold heart more chill ... ...
New Year's Day we call each other to worship each other new year, did not expect the first three your old father left, the first nine your old mother followed closely, Valentine's Day morning you left, and the afternoon of your sister went with you! Only the seventeenth day you a family of four suffered a disaster, the wronged soul floating in the haze of the Wuhan sky, so human tragedy is heart-wrenching collapse, let the heavens answer! I can't imagine you being sad and miserable when You watch your parents leave you for a week and you can't give them one last ride. And at this time you know that your wife and your sister who have come home for the New Year have been infected, and the unprecedented closure of the city so that you have nowhere to ask for help, cruel patients waiting for bed so that you can only be isolated at home waiting for a bed. You understand that this disaster, with your love of the world, you left the last passage of the world: Chinese New Year's Eve night, obey the decree, withdraw the luxury hotel Chinese New Year's Eve banquet. Self-inflicted difficulties will be on the spoon, parents and insiders gathered together, its joy. I do not know, nightmares come, New Year's Day, the old man fever cough, breathing difficulties, sent to a number of hospitals on treatment, are not bed to receive, multi-party help, but also a bed difficult to find. Disappointment, go home to save themselves, bed before filial piety, a few days, back to the days of lack of skill, the old father hates to cast hands, under multiple blows, mother body and mind tired, immunity lost, but also by the strong infection, with the old father went. For several days, the heartless coronavirus devoured my wife and my body. Turn to all the hospitals to cry, how to give a low-minded, hard to find, until the disease, missed the opportunity to heal, the breath of the election, advertising friends and relatives and far in the British my children: My life for the son to do filial piety, for the father dutiful, for the husband and wife, for the people to be sincere! Say goodbye! I love the people and the people who love me.
Sad! Tragic! Heart is like a knife! There's no words!
Thirty years of bitby, as fragments are more like a scene from a movie so vague and clear. We cycled to the China Road Pier every morning to cross the river by ferry at the same time, and we always came to a bike cross-country race when we went ashore, and you could always shake me off on a dozen kilometers of roads. After graduation, as long as small gathering, will mention our cross-country race and Wuhan University brand under that breakfast shop hot dry noodles and soy milk, noodle nest, and then we occasionally small gathering topic sit in the topic of forever inseparable from that part of life in the little bit, Then when you gather, you always touch the already thinning hair on your head and ask me what good way i can make my head full of green silk? In fact, we understand each other that we have been to middle-aged, and this age group of people began to like memories, tend to bemoan, eye socket smaller, not other, just feel that memories of the past can make up for a trace of loss to find a little happiness, for each other's fate feel honored.
You hurried away, let people be unable to prevent, all day in my vague eyes but clearly see you in front of me on a bicycle shouting my name, in the back light you wind-swept long hair is so full of youth hormones, that bike crisp ring and your cries in my confused brain is so clear, It doesnot linger...
Brothers go all the way! Just when your parents in heaven or need your children to accompany, when your brother and sister too filial piety can not bear to make your parents lonely ...
The mountains are the soulof of the tomb, the long song when the crying brother.
I will always remember your name: my brother on the top of the shop - Chang Kai!
Mountains and rivers are exotic, the wind moon the same day, send the Buddhas, together to tie the knot. The afterlife or the students, or brothers!

8. Teacher's lecture in Chengdu Seven Middle School:
Winter can not be sung into the beginning of spring, some people have been buried in winter, and some people should be buried in spring.

Chengdu seven middle school senior students after the winter vacation, this is the language teacher's opening speech:
Those who tell the truth, we should erect a monument for them;
Winter can not be sung into the beginning of spring, some people have been buried in winter, and some people should be buried in winter.
Chengdu seven network school, is the article "this screen may change the fate" in the main character.
The students of the boulevard campus, the students of the high-tech campus, the students of the net school:
Hello!
In this extraordinary period, I am honored to represent our language preparation team and reunite with you in this special class. Today, we replaced the meeting with the wire, the screen instead of the blackboard, although the form is simple, but we for the high school students to help the enthusiasm.
It's already spring, but this winter seems to grow endlessly. New crown pneumonia is still raging, I do not know how many people are facing life and death, and how many families from now on there is no tomorrow.
"The gray of the times, falling on the head of the individual, is a mountain. "For people who are still struggling in pain, it's too extravagant to talk about life, and sometimes, just alive, you've done their best.
So we need to mourn the suffering before us, and we mourn with our hearts and sorrows. Now is the past of the future, and we mourn the suffering before us. Years later, spring came and went, when the sun spread in the grass, when we breathe freely the air, when we happy to gather, we must remember a few years ago, the snow fell on this land. Death is a human tragedy, forgetting is a nation's tragedy.
We also need to repent, for true mourning begins with repentance. We should repent, Mingsor Zhenitsin's warning is deafening, but we pretend to be deaf and dumb, but with the flow, and even to promote. In the end, no one can stay out of the way.
Mr. Lu Xun once said that the lies written by ink cannot hide the fact that the blood is written. "Some people, in order to hold the interests and power that will not be brought into the coffin, while they are still alive, devour their hearts and livers because of greed. When they begin to habitually lie, they are also pushing their relatives and compatriots into the abyss."
History will not disappear by neglect, nor can responsibility be escaped by avoidance. "There is no heroism in all this, it's just an honest question," Camus wrote in The Plague. The only way to fight the plague is to be honest. "
Dr. Li Wenliang left, "We are angry that your warning is regarded as a rumor, we hurt your death is not a rumor." People who tell the truth, we should erect a monument for them, have a name and a last name, and refuse all anonymous memorials.
Suffering will pass, but we can not take the funeral as a happy event, can not change the doubt to praise, can not be blame stolen for dismissal. Winter can not be sung into the beginning of spring, some people have been buried in winter, and some people should be buried in winter.
Suffering will pass, but it is not enough to stop with mourning and repentance, and we must reflect.
In the face of disaster, it is easiest to see human nature; a plague that rips off the shroud that will come out of the way? And what are the cheekbones picking up people's blood in the publicity?
How do we keep our children out of this? How can the next disaster come, there will be more masks, less panic, more responsibility, less push.
In the face of disaster, it is also most easy to see the inner light of mankind.
Which bones stand up in the wind to stand on the shore? Which angels are retrograde to the front line of the outbreak? What ordinary people's kindness makes us tearful? What strangers warm us to rekindle hope?
These fearless and fearless, these indomitable, these little by little, let us see the support of this nation through the vicissitudes, suffering, still standing still the backbone.
We can't avoid disaster, we can do ourselves well, we can't predict the future, we know clearly that the future is in the hands of the children.
Today's numbers, these stories, these characters, these spirits, these lessons, these reflections, can't just appear in textbooks years later, become rigid answer points.
These real things should be known to the children. A quiet desk is hard-won, and you can't just put a head without thought.
We are not outsiders, not now, not in the future. Because, "infinite distance, countless people, are related to me." "

9.《世卫组织报告：新冠病毒与菊头蝠冠状病毒有关联》
中新网 02-12 14:45
中新网2月12日电 据世界卫生组织(WHO)2月11日发布的一份新型冠状病毒(2019-nCoV)情况报告显示，越来越多的证据表明，新冠病毒和在蝙蝠中传播的冠状病毒(CoV)之间存在联系。更具体地说，是与在蝙蝠亚种菊头蝠(Phinolophus bat)中传播的冠状病毒有关。
据报告显示，这些亚种菊头蝠数量很多，广泛分布于中国南部，亚洲、中东、非洲和欧洲。
据最近研究表明，在中国的蝙蝠中，已经发现了500多种冠状病毒。值得注意的是，在血清学研究中，那些居住在蝙蝠自然栖息地洞穴附近的农村人口，其蝙蝠冠状病毒的血清阳性率为2.9%。这表明，人类接触蝙蝠冠状病毒的情况很常见。
然而，报告指出，在疫情一开始时传播给人类的途径仍不清楚。目前，最有可能的假设是，有中间宿主动物在传播中起了一定作用。
报告显示，中国和外部专家小组都在努力确定这种新病毒的动物来源。确定新冠病毒的动物来源将有助于确保未来不会再发生类似的疫情，也将有助于了解该疫情在武汉的最初传播情况。这将增进人类对病毒的了解，并帮助了解这些病毒从动物传染给人类的途径。

10. "These questions, i'd like to ask wuhan virus research institute"
Original Tonic Knife 2020-02-16 16:48:04
Written by: Sinus chapter
At present, in the Chinese people Zhicheng unity against the epidemic of the decisive moment, there is a conspiracy theory of the noise gradually began to become an alternative focus outside the anti-epidemic tragic picture, attracting the world's attention.
Some ulterior foreign media said that the new coronapneumonia virus epidemic affecting the world is the result of the release of the biological weapons virus studied in China, and the source of the virus is wuhan virus research institute.
These questions, would like to ask the Wuhan Virus Research Institute
It is not logical to say that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute is the body that manufactures biological weapons. Any country that has a body that studies biological weapons must be highly confidential. But the Wuhan Virus Research Institute did things, never hidden. Take Shi Zhengli, an expert on coronavirus research, for example, whose research results on coronaviruses have been published in international authoritative journals such as Nature and Science on many occasions, and which can be investigated publicly if her research on coronavirus is aimed at the manufacture of biological weapons, how can the relevant research be published publicly? Therefore, it is not convincing to say that the outbreak was caused by China's development of biological weapons.
However, under the dubious conspiracy theory of "biological weapons", there are a series of relatively reliable problems that need to be addressed by the Wuhan Virus Research Institute:
For example, question one: Has the Wuhan Virus Research Institute synthetically synthesized coronaviruses? What are the similarities and differences between synthetic coronaviruses and the new coronavirusthats that are raging?
According to public information, the research team of Wuhan Virus Research Institute, headed by Shi Zhengli researcher, published a paper entitled "Showing the likelihood of infection with humans in a spreading SARS bat coronavirus group" in the journal Nature Medicine on November 9, 2015. We studied the potential pathogenicity of a sars virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in China's horseshoe manta population. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we identified a chimeric virus in the mouse SARS-CoV skeleton that expressed the bat coronavirus SHC014 spike protein (protrusion protein). The results showed that the 2b group of viruses encoded sylph in wild skeletons could effectively utilize sars receptor, multiple homologous genes of human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), to replicate efficiently in progenitor airway cells and obtain the equivalent price of SARS-CoV strains in vitro.
These questions, would like to ask the Wuhan Virus Research Institute
In addition, invivary experiments showed that the replication of chimeric virus in the lungs of mice had significant pathogenesis. The evaluation of existing SARS-based immunotherapy and prevention methods has shown poor results, and monoclonal antibodies and vaccine methods have failed to neutralize and protect against Covs using the new spike protein. On this basis, we synthesized an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrated the virus's ability to replicate inside and outside the body. "
This paper shows that Shi Zhengli team in the process of studying coronavirus, has been artificially synthesized with infection and in vivo replication capacity of the virus, which is the domestic and foreign suspicion of the new coronavirus from the Wuhan Virus Research Institute's core reasons. In view of the seriousness of the current outbreak and the growing suspicion of public opinion, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute should disclose all relevant information on virus research and publicly explain the similarities and differences between the coronavirus synthesized by Shi Zhengli's team and the new coronavirus that is circulating.
Question 2: If the Wuhan Virus Research Institute has synthesized coronavirus, has there been animal experiments, especially primate experiments? How does the follow-up of the relevant experimental animals proceed?
In the same paper mentioned above, it is said: "Further tests are needed on non-human primates to translate these findings into disease-causing potential in humans." Importantly, the failure of existing therapies demonstrates the urgent need for further research and development of treatments. "So, after the publication of the paper, did the Wuhan Virus Research Institute conduct coronavirus experiments in primates?" Are there any further research and development of treatments, what are the results of the experiment? If there is an experiment, how do the animals used in the experiment deal with it? The answers to this series of questions will be a good response to public suspicion.
Question 3: How did the Wuhan Virus Research Institute know that the American-made Redsiewe has therapeutic effect on the new coronavirus?
Some time ago, Wuhan Virus Research Institute to seize the use of Redsiwe patents in China, causing high public concern, but the focus of public opinion focused on the issue of whether the rush can be successful and whether to do so, while ignoring the magic of the issue of time grabs.
These questions, would like to ask the Wuhan Virus Research Institute
According to public reports, the united States' first case of new coronary pneumonia patients on January 19, 20 confirmed, after 7 days of hospitalization for high fever, the symptoms worsened, in accordance with the United States "sympathetic drug" principle of the use of no official approval of the experimental stage drug Redcievir, found that there is immediate and obvious efficacy. The results were published January 31 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Please note that prior to this, Ridseyway had not been licensed to the U.S. approval agency and was in the experimental stage. On February 2nd, the Drug Review Center of the State Drug Administration of China officially accepted the application for clinical trials of Redsiewe, and on February 6, Redsiewe entered China to conduct clinical trials for approval.
So the problem is, Wuhan Virus Research Institute to rob Redsie in China to use the patent time is January 21. At that time, ordinary Chinese did not know the existence of Redsywe, and Wuhan Virus Research Institute not only know ridsiwe, not yet prophetic knowledge of Redsiwe for the new coronary pneumonia patients, not prophetic knowledge of Redsie wei may enter China, Knowing that the new coronavirus could cause significant damage to China's national interests, The patent was snapped up by Ridseywe to protect the national interest.
It's amazing!
These questions, would like to ask the Wuhan Virus Research Institute
January 20, the country confirmed the case of new coronary pneumonia just reached 291 cases, although that afternoon Zhong Nanshan academician announced that the disease will be passed on, but Wuhan has not yet announced the closure of the city, the national tension has not yet begun, January 22, China's stock market is still rising, the people of the whole country are still in a happy and peaceful atmosphere to welcome the Spring Festival, Can Wuhan Virus Research Institute only rely on the results of in vitro testing, on January 21, in order to protect the national interest to seize a drug in the United States has not been approved for listing, which shows that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute in a long time ago has been carried out related tests, very well understood Redsywe, then please:
1. When did the Wuhan Virus Research Institute foresee that the new coronavirus would cause serious damage to China's national interest and begin the related drug screening work? Have you reported or alerted your supervisor?
2. What is the magic factor that prompted researchers at Wuhan Virus Research Institute to choose a drug that is in the process of treating the Ebola virus, is undergoing clinical research, and has not yet obtained a license from the relevant U.S. authorities (not to mention the approval of the Chinese drug approval agency), In vitro trials as an alternative drug for the treatment of the new coronavirus?
As we all know, whether it is the new coronavirus found by Li Lanxuan team effective Abidore and Dalunawe, or not very reliable double yellow lotus, have been approved by the state, in the country has long been listed, safety has been confirmed drugs, this is the premise of related treatment trials. But Wuhan virus research selected is an unapproved experimental drug to treat the Ebola virus as an alternative drug, which obviously does not meet the requirements of scientific research, unless the Wuhan Virus Research Institute took a wide-netted drug in vitro test, selected a large number of drugs at home and abroad as an alternative, the result finally found Redcivir, Then this requires the Wuhan Virus Research Institute to publish the principles and scope of screening drugs, as well as the conduct of in vitro testing of all information.
3, Wuhan Virus Research Institute how to get Ridsiwe? Redsiewewas's formal entry into China for clinical trials was approved on February 6th, after it was not approved for listing in the U.S., and Redsiewebe said it was not available in the U.S. So how did Wuhan Virus Research Institute get Ridsiewe and conduct in vitro tests before January 21? Has Wuhan Virus Research Institute previously been linked to Gilead, which produces Ridsey? Has there been any cooperation in coronavirus research? It should be described in detail.
These questions, would like to ask the Wuhan Virus Research Institute
4, January 20, the united States the first patient confirmed new coronary pneumonia, January 21 Wuhan Virus Research Institute on the grab Redsiwe, put aside the compactness of this time, it is very puzzling that, in the absence of clinical trials of patients, Wuhan Virus Research Institute only by in vitro experiments, on the grab a not yet listed, Without clinical trials of the domestic patent of U.S. drugs, Wuhan Virus Research Institute's confidence in Redciwe and the urgency of the rush can be seen. But for those with some scientific knowledge and basic medical literacy, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute's extraordinary confidence in Redciway is incomprehensible.
How effective is the in vitro trial of the drug? Some time ago, the research on the treatment of new coronaviruses was also carried out by the Shanghai Drug Institute in conjunction with the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, and was also conducted in vitro tests. That is, before the New England Journal of Medicine declares that Redcywe is clinically effective for new coronary patients, if you believe that Redsiewe is effective in treating new coronaviruses, you should also believe that dijanoter is effective in treating new coronaviruses, because both have passed in vitro tests and double yellow lotus is more reliable than Redcywe. Double Yellow Lotus has at least a national official approval number, and Ridseywe has not yet obtained a production license in the United States. But Wuhan Virus Research Institute not only as one of the two effective drugs to the relevant national institutions reported, but also snapped the patent of Redsiewe, this redwest of the super-high confidence in where? Is it because of in vitro test results? If only by the results of in vitro tests, Wuhan Virus Research Institute why did not recommend the relevant state agencies double yellow lotus oral solution!
What to ask is, if the United States has never had a case, Redsiewe in the United States can not be clinical trials, China's relevant institutions because of Wuhan Virus Research provided by Redsiewe inhibited the effective report of the new coronavirus, and from the United States to introduce Redsiewe?
These questions, would like to ask the Wuhan Virus Research Institute
5, on the face of it, Wuhan Virus Research Institute and the United States Gilead, which produces Ridsey, are both sides of the game. Wuhan Virus Research Institute to seize the Redsiway patent is to "safeguard the national interest", checks and balances Gilead company. But in fact, wuhan virus research institute is also one of Redsie's promoters in China, because Redsiewe is one of the two effective anti-coronavirus drugs, as early as January 21, was reported by the Wuhan Virus Research Institute to the relevant national institutions, if not the New England Journal of Medicine reports, Redsiewe wants to enter China , really rely on the recommendation of Wuhan Virus Research Institute. However, when the New England Journal of Medicine announced that Redsiewe was clinically effective, public opinion exploded, pushing the Chinese authorities to take special cases, and immediately accepted and approved Redsiewe's application to enter China, on February 2. At this time, for Gilead, Wuhan Virus Research Institute in China to promote the role of Redsiewe is relatively small. But on February 4th, when Redsiewe was about to enter China for clinical trials, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute issued a statement snapping up Redsie's patent in China.
This is the whole thing, it looks normal and strange. If Wuhan Virus Research Institute found that Redsiwe is effective in the treatment of the new coronavirus, in order to cure people, but also in order to show their major achievements, why not in the first time to rush the issue of January 21 statement? And wait until the relevant state departments accept Ridsie's application to enter China before issuing a statement, is not clear warning Gilead, your Chinese use of patents in my hands? Is Wuhan Virus Research Institute really in order to protect the national interest, to grab a drug that has not yet been listed?
6, Gilead should also respond to public concerns as an incident-related party. Has Gilead previously cooperated with Wuhan Virus Research Institute? Have you obtained a virus synthesized by Wuhan Virus Research Institute? Has Redcyvir been studied for the treatment of coronavirus-like viruses in addition to SARS and MERS?
The reason for questioning Gilead is that, like the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, it is fascinated by Redciewe's ability to treat the new coronavirus. From The "first" application of Redsywe to clinical treatment in humans, to January 31st, when the New England Journal of Medicine announced that Redsiewe was effective in treating the new coronavirus, less than a week after patients had not even been discharged from the hospital, Redsywe began to shape the image of the treatment of new coronavirus drugs in China. In order to cure the disease and save people, on February 2nd, China's relevant institutions accepted Theridriver application, February 6 formally approved its entry into China's clinical trials, Redsiewe and Gilead with "light speed" through the new drug into China to carry out clinical trials the shortest way. And all this, after only one case! This is the miracle of the world's medical history, if not the odd one. Among all the participants, except for the China National Drug Administration Drug Review Center because of the rescue of people's hearts, special affairs, other parties have played a very large slip.
These questions, would like to ask the Wuhan Virus Research Institute
First, the first-case u.S. treatment agency used Ridsywe, seven days after the patient was admitted to hospital, and on the 10th day of admission, it revealed that the patient had improved significantly (but it was not clear what channel it had to say), but the agency did not say that the new corona patient had been cured by Redciewe. Their use of Ridsyway is based on the "sympathetic drug" principle of the American health system. In the New England Journal of Medicine, only describing the patient's symptoms as being quickly alleviated, and not saying that Redciewe can cure new coronary pneumonia, the authors specifically stressed that the safety and efficacy of Redciewe and other drugs in the treatment of new coronavirus infections has not yet been determined. In other words, the New England Journal of Medicine is actually a trick, two-headed block, never said that Redsiewe can cure the new coronavirus, and in the domestic media here, Redsiewe has become a special treatment of Redciewe special effects. Public opinion detonated, in an objective push for the country's relevant institutions of the speed of approval.
So, does Redsieway really work? Ridsiewe has been clinically used in China for nearly ten days, and has not seen a significant decline in the mortality rate of patients with new coronary pneumonia, with dozens of people still dying every day. But Ridsywe has become the most explosive drug in the outbreak that has yet to prove its effectiveness.
And Wuhan Virus Research Institute as early as January 21, on this is convinced, the drug reported to the state, and seize the patent, please ask the magic Wuhan Virus Research Institute, how to do the prophet?

      It should be noted that during my Ph.D., and after a period of time, I have been engaged in the laboratory of ordinary drug experiments, vaccines and other basic work, familiar with the work of biological laboratory and biological basis, between this, between a basic scientific conscience, the Following WeChat shi Zhengli is very angry!
     In the face of tens of thousands of people infected, tens of thousands of families fragmented, hundreds of lives, stone researchers blatantly lie also calculated, but also scold edified these unfortunate people should live, because you are your own uncivilized habitof punishment, please ask these people are eating bats to eat? Ridiculous! And to question the scientists you study shut up, you've lost the most basic basic element of a researcher: seeking truth from facts, and the social bottom line of a researcher: human nature.
    When you say such a thing, I am really by your anger bite teeth, then I will publicly expose your lies, expose the double yellow under the naked lies.
    1. From bats to humans, how does the new coronavirus mutate?
Is this a model of the SARS virus, see her pretty purple mushroom din? Please take notes, it is called spike glycol protain, short for S protein, this protein is very important, he is the key, can pass on people, rely on it.
The virus on the bat, its S protein, can not be transmitted, otherwise, a bat can kill hundreds of thousands of people more than, so eat the bat this lie, basically impossible. It is called a key to open a lock.
    But the virus has lived on Earth for 400,000 years, and they are constantly looking for hosts and mutations to survive.
Well, from bats to humans, coronavirus to continue to obtain human protein information, if only rely on people to eat, at least eat more than 10,000 years, "living" virus to obtain human protein information, and bats are not companion animals, it is difficult to get human protein information from blood, body fluids and other ways.
For example, cats also have HIV virus, commonly known as cat AIDS, but even in close contact with people, cat HIV hiv is not transmitted, because the cat AIDS can not open a person's password.
    So, how can a coronavirus from a bat mutate into a 2019-nCoV coronavirus? There are two possibilities 1. Natural Variation s2.Laboratory Modification Virus
First, natural variation
   So let's start with natural variation, first of all, the bat host virus, to find 1 - 2 intermediate host in nature, through this 1-2 intermediate host gradually find the human genetic code mutation.
This is basically not possible with the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, because if the 2019-nCoV is found, then the first to find this intermediate host, such as sars virus will first catch on the beaver, but 2019-nCoV is missing this intermediate host, But it was tracked directly to the bat by the academician Gaofu.
   The academician was well aware that the 2019-nCoV was missing the ring, but he did not say or did not say clearly, only that he had an official status in addition to the scientists, which could not be said to him.
So the variation of nature is basically ruled out.
    Second, the modification variation of the laboratory
   Then, why can the Academician go over the middle host and find the 2019-nCoV source bat? The only basis is a large database of large bat viruses.
Well, here finally catch up with Shi Zhengli researcherhere here, look at Shi Zhengli these years of research results and work, her database has not less than 50 in the coronavirus, without this bat coronavirus database, Gaofu academician is not possible in the very soon screening out of the bat this host.
   So the original virus of 2019-nCoV is stored in Shi Zhengli's virus library.
   2. Well, let's take another look at the small purple mushroom of the coronavirus, artificially replace it, is it difficult? It is not difficult ah, if you will not change this, it is not a student, it can be said that 80% of China's biological graduate students will, Wuhan University's Institute of Biology casually pick a few students will be replaced, because the tutor is very strong. Not to mention that dr. Rao's Peking University School of Life Sciences, for graduate students who study biology, if not, can not get a diploma.
The operation process need not be said, is a kind of physical work.
   3. How the new coronavirus is spreading
Well, after you get or replace the purple mushroom din with the coronavirus, what's the lab going to do next? Of course, it is necessary to plant viruses in the new host ah, record some of these virus host's list of biochemical indicators and transmission routes.
   What are these hosts? That's the lab's experimental animals, they're really likely, no less likely than those in the water, and we call them SPF animals.
   I've also raised SPF animals, and I've been ashamed and deeply remorseful for being human, and even if I've been vegetarian for life, I can't get rid of this confessional mentality, not to mention those poor patients in the aquatic hot-water epidemic zone, and with every thought of it, I can think of the creatures that have souls in the cages.
Well, a virus that modifies the S-protein, spreading between hosts, where the host becomes an optional SPF animal - mice, rats, and monkeys.
   The way the virus spreads is common lying, 1. droplets spread, such as influenza virus 2. Blood transmission, such as HIV 3. Mother-to-child transmission, such as the hepatitis B virus.
Then this is the scientist, in fact, the experimenter in modifying the virus, will choose the virus and the host of the protein to determine how to spread.
Well, this is the time to test the conscience and interests of scientists, if the choice of mother-to-child transmission, even the fastest-breeding mice, such as mice mature pregnancy, but also 22 days for a breeding cycle, chickens also need 21 days incubation. Choosing blood transmission is dangerous and can easily contaminate if not handled properly.
So in order to achieve results as soon as possible, the fastest mode of transmission is generally chosen, respiratory transmission, the World Health Organization published data:
2019-nCoV invades the human body through ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein receptors in human respiratory and lung cells. Patients at the beginning of the general fever, fatigue, dry cough as the main manifestation, but nasal congestion, runny nose and so on.
So how did the virus accurately choose the switch of this person? The following paper details this process, and this paper, Shi Zhengli is one of the authors:
https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985?fbclid=IwAR0iTTfDlT-uxNFPtvQH-xFrF6QaF1hKE1Ey2TPrEi17XfFUElbpUlAosDc
In 2015, a paper was published in the prestigious electronic journal of natural medicine, by Shi Zhengli, a professor at the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Virology of Wuhan University.
Their medical research found that the virus could be transmitted to humans as soon as the receptor of ACE2 in the S protein in the bat was switched on and off, the paper said. Using viral gene recombination techniques to recombine the S protein in bats and sars viruses in mice in small mice, the new virus can be combined with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can infect human respiratory cells very effectively, and is highly toxic. They found that the new virus had significantly damaged the lungs of mice, and that all vaccine tubes were inactive. So, Shi Zhengli's team continued to experiment with monkeys to simulate the effects of the virus on the human body.
    The experiment was highly controversial in the U.S. medical community at the time, and medical expert Declan Butler wrote on Nature Medicine that the experiment was pointless and risky. Due to lack of technology, Shi Zhengli's team was working with a medical team in North Carolina. When the U.S. Centers for Disease Control realized in 2014 that the virus could become a biological chemical weapon, it immediately halted the virus modification program and stopped funding for related research.
There must be a great risk of conducting this kind of research, so the following link is a questionable article:
https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787?fbclid=IwAR3DUjcRIlGF5_d6XOS4mm_ZlzWUwgGaHZZPYVp3_UaznsQWsftDU5EVQDY#/ref-link-2
Well, I and Shi Zhengli researcher's confrontation, basically here, stone research laboratory staff have 2019-nCoV original bat-hosted virus samples and coronavirus database, also mastered the way to transform into 2019-nCoV, my words are here, as far as the process, I did not see, Do not analyze.
    This new virus, which would have been permanently sealed in the highest-insurance laboratory, was sealed or destroyed forever, but unfortunately it escaped, causing tens of thousands of infections and hundreds of deaths, and the culprit we saw it and caught it, but we haven't destroyed it yet. To this end countless doctors and rescue workers rushed to the front line to participate in the rescue, that is Shi Zhengli researcher said to take responsibility for life.
So finally, I'm going to say two things:
   1, we are to borrow Shi Zhengli ten hundred courage, she also dare not put the virus into the community, that is against human sin, not only she dare not, all scientists will not do so, this is against our oath: for the sake of human health.
   2, this is not a Chinese conspiracy, this project was funded by the United States in 2014, then the stop was stopped by the United States, and most importantly, no group or institution can profit from this plague, because it concerns the entire human race.
  3, this can only be a feast after the accident.
   4, in addition, I would like to Shi Yigong, Rao Yi, as well as those who are the capital chasing life scientists and students who want to read the code of life and devote themselves to it to say a word: interpretation of the code of life, human beings have a long way to go, perhaps we are a grain of paving stone, a small molecule of small protein, do not rush to benefit, do not be too delusional, The feast of capital should cool down a while.

13.《中央媒体怒批：凌晨两点还在“填表”，哪有精力抗击新冠肺炎！》
筑城戒毒之声
中央媒体怒批：凌晨两点还在“填表”，哪有精力抗击新冠肺炎！
抗疫中的形式主义：工作人员凌晨两点还在填表，内容越来越多
在武汉市主城区的一个新冠肺炎防控指挥部，9日凌晨两点，记者看到工作人员还在填写各种表格。一位工作人员反映，防疫表格的内容越来越多，各层各级数据统计量非常大，非常浪费时间。
中央媒体怒批：凌晨两点还在“填表”，哪有精力抗击新冠肺炎！
新冠肺炎疫情形势仍然严峻。中央强调，在疫情防控工作中，要坚决反对形式主义、官僚主义，让基层干部把更多精力投入到疫情防控第一线。
“新华视点”记者调查发现，重复繁重的填表任务、空洞鼓劲的动员会、停不下来的“迎检大战”、作秀留痕晒表扬……这些重在刷存在感的行为，消耗了基层干部大量时间、精力，耽误落实迫在眉睫的抗疫工作，引发群众不满。
形形色色的形式主义令基层不堪重负
中央媒体怒批：凌晨两点还在“填表”，哪有精力抗击新冠肺炎！
——“表格抗疫”。北京、江苏、广东等多地基层干部向记者反映，防疫期间一天要填报十几份表格，这些表格由不同部门下发，内容基本相同，只是格式、体例稍有差异。
“上级很多部门下发的表格、各级防疫小组的表格都要填，内容基本相同，就是重复填写。”广东省清远市一位村支书告诉记者，防疫工作开展以来，被各类表格弄得焦头烂额，而且有些表格内容已超出了工作能力范围。例如，一项针对外来人口的检查项目，要求录入外来人员咽痛、全身乏力、眼结膜充血等情况，“村干部量量体温还行，乏力、干咳这些临床症状需要专业医生来判断，我们怎么懂啊？”
武汉某高校一教师说，春节前从武汉返乡后不到10天时间，就接到市、街道、社区、卫健局、教育局、派出所等各部门的电话，填写了来自社区、卫健局、教育局和疫情防控指挥部等多个部门的表格，内容都大同小异。
——“迎检大战”。“来了一拨又一拨检查的，就没看到一瓶消毒水、一只口罩发下来。”江苏省泰州市一街道办工作人员反映，这几天他为了应对上级各类检查忙得团团转，有时一天要来好几拨。每来一拨，街道、社区就要安排多人陪同。“这些检查很多都流于形式，解决不了实际问题，简直是‘迎检大战’。”
——鼓劲式会议。一位医生在朋友圈吐槽，武汉一家医院急诊科主任在一个开会现场愤然离席，原因是各级领导到医院开了三拨会，每次都长篇大论读最新文件、政策，为医护人员加油鼓劲，花去大约3小时。急诊科主任不得不带走医生：我们是继续抢救病人还是继续和你们开会？
某高校要求中层干部到学校开会，数百人聚集在会议室，参加校领导召开的传达政策、动员鼓劲视频会。不少教师抱怨，相关信息完全可以通过微信和视频传递，毫无必要让大家聚在一起开会，徒增风险。
——作秀留痕。江苏泰州市一名基层干部说，抗疫工作还在紧急关头，有些干部仍不忘晒工作照留痕。比如，街道成立临时党支部，这本是加强抗疫领导工作的需要，但有的领导热衷的却是组织集中宣誓、拍照，基层不得不紧急安排场地、横幅、屏幕等。
湖北某市一社区动员居民参加防疫志愿服务，活动还没进行，先要组织志愿者拍合影。“反复强调不要聚集，不理解为啥要让大家拍合影。”不少居民质疑。
需专门抽调人员做“表哥”“表姐”，影响抗疫工作实效
中央媒体怒批：凌晨两点还在“填表”，哪有精力抗击新冠肺炎！
多地基层干部反映，各种形式主义消耗了本就紧张的人力、物力，对抗疫工作造成明显干扰。
在武汉市主城区的一个新冠肺炎防控指挥部，9日凌晨两点，记者看到工作人员还在填写各种表格。一位工作人员反映，防疫表格的内容越来越多，各层各级数据统计量非常大，非常浪费时间。“我们指挥部办公室一半的人晚上都在填表，8个人从早填到晚，街道的工作人员接到我们电话都哭了。”
湖南省长沙市某社区一共12名工作人员，要服务近万名常住居民和流动人口，每天要承担防控宣传、辖区巡查、送医协调、消毒、居民劝导、物资发放等大量工作，人手非常紧张，还不得不抽出两个人做“表哥”“表姐”，专门承担数据收集、登记造表、上报信息等任务。社区主任抱怨：“人手这么紧张，却要花费很多时间重复填表报资料，这是对基层防控力量的严重浪费。”
形式主义还影响了防疫工作的实效。江苏泰州一名乡镇干部介绍，上级频频督查检查，但检查只是到值守点检查人员是否在岗。乡镇本就人手紧张，还要专门安排人员值守应对督查，导致人手更加紧张，一些摸排、巡查、消毒的工作无奈只好草草了事。
形式主义引发防控一线干部和群众的不满。广东省清远市一村支书说：“大家本来就精神紧张、劳累，平白还增加了很多无用工作，累心。”一些社区工作者说，总进行重复调查，却无法解决物资、医疗等问题，不少市民已表示不满。
严肃问责，提高治理能力
中央媒体怒批：凌晨两点还在“填表”，哪有精力抗击新冠肺炎！
当前，一些地方开始采取措施，整治疫情防控中的形式主义、官僚主义。2月6日，湖北省纪委机关、省委组织部发出通知，对疫情防控工作中的形式主义、官僚主义问题依规依纪依法从重从快查处；黑龙江省纪委监委要求，坚决纠治疫情防控过分注重填表格、要数据、报材料，增加基层负担等形式主义、官僚主义行为。
湖北省恩施土家族苗族自治州纪委监委12日通报了4起在疫情防控中履职不力典型案例，8名乡镇主职干部因形式主义、官僚主义等被问责，其中2名党委书记被免职。
据福建省纪委监委日前通报，省纪检监察机关严肃追责问责疫情防控工作不力问题，共查处100起、处理170人，其中给予党纪政务处分12人。通报指出，在查处的问题中，有的工作不实、失职失责，有的麻痹大意、疏于管理，有的推诿卸责、履职不力，是典型的形式主义、官僚主义。
不少专家提出，重点还要解决防疫工作中多部门缺乏协调问题。武汉大学中国乡村治理研究中心研究员吕德文认为，“表格抗疫”的问题，直接原因是指挥协调系统不完整不科学，各个部门之间没有形成一个专门的信息统筹机制，应明确专门部门收集信息，从机制上避免各部门、各条线向基层派任务和要表格。
北京大学廉政研究中心副主任庄德水表示，确有必要的数据统计，应归口统一的部门一次收集，不能多头要数据，增加基层负担。可通过大数据统计、在线填报等新办法有效减轻基层负担。他表示，去年以来基层减负效果明显，但基层治理体系和部分干部的思想观念仍没有根本性转变，很多人还是习惯用文山会海、上报数据的方式开展工作。抗击疫情需要务实的态度，也需要现代化的管理方式，并运用高科技的手段。
国务院联防联控机制11日召开的新闻发布会上提出，要在地方联防联控机制协调下，统筹管理，一定要减少重复报表、重复报数。不要把基层有没有发文、有没有记录作为检查督导的标准，要为基层减轻不必要的负担，使他们真正全身心投入到疫情防控工作中。

14. "The U.S. media asked Hubei why he changed his coach, my Ambassador responded"
Global Times Yesterday
On February 13, Ambassador Cui Tiankai answered questions about China's fight against the new coronal pneumonia outbreak and China-U.S. relations in an interview with Steve Inskeep, host of NPR's Morning News. Part of the interview was broadcast on the morning of February 14 local time, and the entire content of the interview was posted on the NPR website, which read as follows: Inskip: How long do you think this outbreak will last, how long will it take China to contain the crisis, days, weeks or months?
Ambassador Cui: I certainly hope that the sooner the better. But that depends on a number of factors, including our efforts, including whether we are working in the right direction and whether methods and tools are effective. We are doing our best and I have full confidence in our scientists and medical staff.
Inskip: Does the tension between China and the U.S. make cooperation in the fight against the epidemic difficult?
Ambassador Cui: Obviously, the international community is facing the challenges posed by the outbreak, and China and the United States need to cooperate. In a phone call, President Xi Jinping and President Trump agreed that the two countries should strengthen cooperation in dealing with the outbreak. We are very grateful to the American people, businesses, non-governmental organizations and others for their support and help.
Inskip: Do you think cooperation is working as normal despite overall difficulties?
Ambassador Cui: Civil cooperation has not been affected in any way, very effective and very sincere. We were deeply moved by the kindness of the American people. But there's a big "but" here, some politicians in this country, maybe some in the media - sorry to say that, because you're from the media too - they're not helping, some are trying to take advantage of people. That's not good.
Inskip: Can you give an example?
Ambassador Cui: If you look at the news, you'll find out.
Inskip: U.S. Commerce Secretary Ross commented on the outbreak a few days ago, saying he would n'no say he was happy about the outbreak, but the outbreak was a factor companies need to consider when determining their supply chains. I understand what he is saying is that this outbreak provides another reason for U.S. companies to leave China.
Ambassador Cui: Many American media and economists have commented on his remarks and expressed their views. So I have nothing to add.
Inskip: What points do you mean?
Ambassador Cui: What are the points? As far as I know, many people can't agree.
Inskip: Disagree with his statement?
Ambassador Cui: Yes.
Inskip: Of course, he's talking about a broader "decoupling" that should reduce the link between the U.S. economy and the Chinese economy. Whether you like it or not, do you think this is happening?
Ambassador Cui: I don't think "decoupling" should happen, nor can it happen. Because we are the world's two largest economies, it is in the interestof both countries that we are so closely linked and interdependent. Both economies and people have benefited from the continuous development of economic and trade relations. Why would anyone want to cut off this relationship in an attempt to "decoupling"?
Inskip: In your opinion, does this mean that the Measures taken by the Trump administration, such as restricting Huawei or other Chinese companies and pushing U.S. companies to Vietnam, will ultimately fail?
Ambassador Cui: The good news is that we have signed the first phase of the China-U.S. Economic and Trade Agreement. This proves that both sides are willing to solve problems and maintain and develop bilateral economic and trade relations. It was a good try by both sides. At the same time, I think it is not possible to follow the objective logic of economy and technology. U.S. companies must also weigh the pros and cons, aiming at optimal resource allocation and productivity, and act ingly with economic rules rather than the wishes of any politician.
Inskip: I think of the recent decision by the UK to use Huawei 5G devices in some of its networks, despite repeated usurping that the US would not do so. As you can see, is this an example of following economic rules?
Ambassador Cui: I don't want to comment on people from other countries. But I think in some ways america should probablly learn from Britain. The UK has made more informed decisions on issues such as joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) early and benefiting from it, and making its own decision on whether to use Huawei's 5G technology. I think the British are rational.
Inskip: Because you mentioned the economic and trade agreement, I'd like to ask the general direction of the U.S.-China relationship. I think the U.S.-China relationship may have been going downhill over the past few years, and is the U.S.-China relationship picking up after the (first phase) economic and trade agreement? Or what else do you think you're moving in?
Ambassador Cui: The first phase of the economic and trade agreement is the result of China and the United States' important efforts to develop a healthier and more stable bilateral relationship. I certainly hope that the agreement will be effectively implemented and will help to inject positive energy into the overall bilateral relationship. Of course, we still have political, security and other issues that need to be addressed. The lessons we have learned from the economic and trade consultations may also help us to solve problems in other areas. The first phase of the economic and trade agreement could not be reached without the principle of mutual respect and equality. The teams of both sides do their utmost to enhance mutual understanding, respect each other's legitimate rights and concerns, and solve problems in a balanced manner on an equal basis. If both sides continue to uphold these principles in resolving issues in other areas, I believe we can also succeed.
Inskip: There's one more problem. I think you must have been concerned about the impeachment case against President Trump and his acquittal. Part of the impeachment case is about China. President Trump has been criticized for seeking Ukraine's help in investigating his political rival, Joe Biden. When he was criticized for the incident, he said he was right, called for an investigation into Biden and urged China to investigate Biden's or his son's investments in China. How does the Chinese government respond to Mr. Trump's comments?
Ambassador Cui: China has never been involved in the internal affairs of the United States, and we will never do so.
Inskip: Does that mean that if the President of the United States asks China to investigate Biden, China will not respond in any way?
Ambassador Cui: I don't think this issue has been discussed in formal communication between the two governments.
Inskip: So, if the U.S. makes a formal request through official channels, will China consider it? Or do you think this is not a problem that china should solve?
Ambassador Cui: I think that's part of the domestic political drama in the United States. We're just bystanders.
Inskip: I'm sorry, but I know our interview is coming to an end. But I know you've been in the U.S. for a long time and you're a veteran U.S. affairs observer. So now that there's a chance to come face-to-face with you, I have to ask, what do you think of watching the american political drama of recent months?
Ambassador Cui: China and the United States are both world powers and the two largest economies. There are indeed similarities between the two countries. It is natural for any great power to take on greater responsibilities and, in many cases, set ambitious goals for themselves. At the same time, China and the United States are rooted in different civilizations. We may all have some problems and from time to time we face great challenges. The United States has its own problems and challenges, and China has its own problems and challenges. But I have always believed that whether China and the United States can truly grow strong and build a better future depends largely on our respective domestic governance. At present, the United States may need to address some issues to strengthen domestic governance. China also needs to meet the challenges and modernize its governance system and capacity. If both sides can handle their internal affairs, then we will have a better future. So we're watching, too. Of course, I hope the American people are lucky and have a better future.
Inskip: Ambassador Cui, it's an honor to talk to you again. Thank you so much.

15. "Yu Minhong 14 Outbreak Diary: As long as everyone looks like a person, the country will look like a country"
The following article is from Porridge Zolo
Author l River Does not Flow

Reprinting please contact authorization (WeChat ID: shoujirym8754)
It has been 21 days since January 23rd, when Wuhan sealed the city.
Big multimedia likened the fight against the new crown pneumonia to a war, which was made up of many battles. From Zhong Nanshan to Li Wenliang, from the crazy grab double yellow even oral liquid to the appeal of the Wuhan Red Cross, never go out, do not add confusion, lying is to contribute to the country to a vote of small and medium-sized enterprises said to support but three months, lying down until the resumption of work only to find that the return to work is also unemployed ...
The fighting began time and time again, most people across the shore to watch the fire, a small number of people in the micro-blog and friends circle waving flags and shouting.
There is a saying in "Embarrassing" Hazelmin that people speak of "morality" only when they do not have any interestins.
We are all vulgar, and all positions stem from being able to stay out of the way without being infected or directly impacted. And the real warriors are the ones who have stormed the front lines of this war against the epidemic.
They may be front-line medical staff, such as Zhong Nanshan, Li Wenliang, may be unfortunately infected with the virus patients and their families, such as Wuhan's Qi, her father, mother, brother have all been diagnosed; He donated 5,000 masks in the outbreak, and could be business owners who have been directly hit, such as today's protagonist, New Oriental Chairman Yu Minhong.
Since January 30, Yu Minhong has written 14 consecutive "Epidemic Diary". In his diary on February 7th, he wrote:
Mr. Lu Xun wants us to "cross-brow cold to the thousand-husband finger, bow down for the mule cow", but many of us have "hidden into the small building into a unified, control him winter and summer and spring and autumn."
No one is an island, and no one is alone.
Yu Minhong is an entrepreneur, but the base of this identity is the same as our Chinese.
In the social disaster, public crisis and other huge times of the flood, in fact, everyone has only one identity: Chinese. This is a community, all the glory, all the damage.
Just as yesterday's tearful video of Dr. Li Wenliang, a member of the Zhong Nanshan Academician, they all belong to the community of doctors.
Today's article is close to ten thousand words, is I combined with Yu Minhong "Epidemic Diary" and the world under the epidemic, combing and summing up. I believe that after you finish, you will gain something.
01
About Public Administration
The highness of the temple, the people are worried about
The distance of the river and lake, then worry about its king
In his diary, Yu Minhong wrote this sentence:
My mother scolded me when she was a child, the most words are, "Why don't you remember long?" "
This disaster is both a natural disaster and a man-made disaster. We often say pain, do not like SARS, the outbreak passed, good scars forget pain, wait until the next outbreak comes and busy.
After the outbreak, if Wuhan can attach great importance to timely release of the outbreak alert, or the people have more voice and response channels, grass-roots issues can be the first time by the decision-making level to learn, will not cause the current nationwide epidemic.
Many things, we know the truth is often too late. Before the little things become big things, they are often layerbyundered, layer by layer information isolation. Wait until it becomes a big deal, then top-down accountability, layer by layer serioustreatment.
Layer reporting management methods, decided that anything would rather do the head, but also than there is a leak. As if only too much to tell the head, I have done my best. But if encountered the need to take the opportunity to decide, on-the-spot decision-making things, and dare not take on, layer by layer reporting, and then layer by layer approval down, delay the timing.
The logic behind this is that while layers are responsible, each layer is trying to shirk the responsibility it should have taken.
For example, Hubei Red Cross, the Chinese people donated so many funds and materials, or not to distribute it, or the distribution of the hospital is not right, and even the privileged to obtain, and some people sell donated materials online for profit. For example, Wuhan Charity Federation, to accept charitable donations from all walks of life 3 billion yuan, but 2.7 billion yuan of which will be handed over to the financial.
This is life-saving money ah, should be earmarked.
In contrast, Kyushu Tong took over the distribution of Red Cross supplies, only two hours, the storage of supplies to the various hospitals. At the same time the news came out that Han Hong personally for the Han Hong Foundation received materials for distribution, tired to hospital.
The Chinese have two old sayings, one is "in their place, seek their government", the other is "the high temple, worry about its people;
This time the delay in the fight against the outbreak, so that many people are reflecting on the problem of what is the problem? Weibo netizen slu Jiqun said it well:
"After the great loss and pain we are also reflecting, who is the murderer?" It's called calllessness and callousness. Day by day reported the cold figures, there is no one word of mourning, what is the human feeling? It's called disposal of incompetence. A month has passed, donated vegetables into the market for sale, donated things to the warehouse, patients have no place to medical, no place to buy supplies. It's called caution. Found the problem, dare not clapboard, layer reporting, layer approval, miss the warplane. It is also a loophole-free emergency mechanism, is not a professional management team, is the same as the comprehensive assessment system. "

About the common people
The Chinese are always the bravest of them.
It's well protected.
In his diary, Yu Minhong wrote:
I am a person who comes out of the bottom, has always been more concerned about the lives and destiny of ordinary people, want to know them, see what can be done for them. If every day in the high-rise building between the five-star hotel, do not understand the people's living conditions, it is equivalent to you completely do not understand China.
The chinese people are the best people in the world.
Want them to stand up, up to entrepreneurs, down to sanitation workers, donations and donations are not willing, even if the enterprise itself is facing an existential crisis, even if the donation is their own old-age life saving money is at all costs.
In the midst of the outbreak, you see this news almost every day:
Farmers to their own vegetables directly to the medical team, the owner of small restaurants every day free of charge for medical staff to make hundreds of meals, travel abroad people directly to a box of masks back to the hands of public officials, medical staff and volunteers, take the initiative to grab the first line, a total of the national conditions of the national disaster, the Chinese than any other country in the world is higher.
And when they step down, they have a high degree of obedience and cooperation. Whether it is the city or traffic stop, the people's complaints are not much, and even play a unique Chinese-style humor, self-deprecating lying at home can also contribute to the country's days to cherish.
A reporter interviewed Wuhan volunteers, weibo netizens , spider baobab, asked him why he came out as a volunteer? He said: "I am Wuhan, after all, this is our city ah!" "
As Chinese, we were born in S, long in S, song crying in s, in fact, behind the deep love of this land under foot. As Kissinger said in On China:
"The Chinese are always well protected by the bravest of them."
03
About Society
As long as everyone looks like a person.
The country is bound to look like a nation.
Yu Minhong's thinking in his diary is worth everyone's careful reading:
I have always believed that a good society is to make as many people as possible more and more kind society. What mechanism should we put in place to allow the goodness between people to be passed on, so that evil and abominable behavior can be minimized or even disappeared?
First of all, the promotion of people, to put first, after all, the country is composed of people. It's especially good to read a sentence today:
"A country is not abstract, it is a community of individuals, a nation supported by the people; "
In addition, how to cultivate the rational spirit and scientific spirit of the Chinese people is an important topic in Chinese education. In essence, we are an emotional nation, our Confucian culture is based on emotional attachment as a prerequisite.
There is too little education in our education for rational ability and independent judgment. Following the feeling has become a major feature of us.
Because of the lack of rationality, it is easy to be dominated by emotions, easy to be fooled: Internet finance is fooled, buy health care products are fooled, buy a variety of drugs are fooled, and even a few days ago there have been the people of the whole country crazy to grab double yellow even oral liquid farce.
04
About human nature.
Our individual rights
There's no real guarantee since ancient times.
In his diary, Yu Minhong said:
This outbreak, has not only a war between people and viruses, more like a mirror, a lot of demons and demons, the charm of the original, is a human nature in the good and evil ugly big fight.
A few days ago in Japan, there are wuhan a family of three to fly back to Chongqing, has done a full protection, there is no symptoms of infection, but by all the passengers on the plane blocked, not to board the plane. The Japanese persuaded for half a day to use, and finally a lonely family of three was left at the airport, at a loss.
Such things have happened more than once, each time deepening the indifference and hatred between people.
Wuxi a person was suspected of being isolated, the street actually took his kitten to the field to be buried alive, and the street originally promised to let the cat in the home isolation.
A 69-year-old man from Ya'an was diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia. He deliberately concealed the fact that he returned to Ya'an via Hankou, Wuhan, and made many activities outside, with close contacts of more than 100 people, including more than 30 medical personnel. Doctors have repeatedly asked him if he has lived and traveled in Wuhan, Hubei and other places, which he has always denied.
Wuhan has a small area, there is a mother in order to protect themselves, the community door locked up, do not let the nurse sit home to rest. And to say that is because little Nizi is a hospital, afraid of infection on us, so do not let you come in.
What is even more abhorrent is that when the people of the whole country mourndr Dr. Li Wenliang, there are people who are scolding Li Wenliang, saying that his infectious disease information is a reputation, in order to pull the flow of their own, after the performance is to get donations from others.
I have always believed that no matter how evil a person is, there is a residual conscience. As Wang Yangming said, he would be ashamed to let the thief take off his last pair of shorts.
Every time I see such news, it always gives a deep sense of powerlessness. For example, some places prohibit Wuhan people from entering the country, the Wuhan people's bad words, all over the road behind, although the necessary self-protection, but also leaked a kind of indifference, a kind of self-protection of each person from the front of the door.
Yu Minhong in his diary frankly, would like to explore the deep-seated reasons behind this.
In fact, from ancient times to the present, many of our individual rights have not been truly guaranteed, a right is not guaranteed, there is no long-term sense of security. So on the formation of two mentality, one is good hastentooccupies, because if not to seize, after the village there is no shop, along this line, we have developed a person not for their own world-to-day thinking logic.
Another kind of mentality is that the good or bad of others has nothing to do with me, since I do not have a long-term sense of security, why should I care about the rights of others?
It is useless for us to blame others, and we have to think about why there is a social soil that produces such people and thus improves the structure of the social soil.
05
About the media
Pseudo-intellectuals are more based on the advantage of self-interest
Real intellectuals judge on universal values
Yu Minhong wrote two passages in his diary, please:
Some of the writers who like to celebrate virtue have begun publishing poems and stories describing how hard government officials have struggled to combat the outbreak. One of them, almost the county party secretary and county chief wrote more than three through the door and not into the big dragonfly more cattle figure.
At such times, the real conscience of the media should seriously care about ordinary people, those infected with the disease and those who are fighting on the front line of health care workers, what is their situation? Instead of following the leader, farts run upside down. Leaders may be really hard, but it seems better to wait until the outbreak is over and then look at the right and wrong. In retrospect, we can see things more clearly.
Fortunately, we are always someone who sticks to our value system, Fang said, "Now I am not the president of the Hubei Writers Association, but I am still a writer." I would like to remind my Hubei counterpart that you will most likely be asked to write carols in the future, but please think for a few seconds when you write, who the object you want to sing should be. If you want to be flattered, please also keep a degree. Although I am old, but My criticism is never old. "
Fang said: "It seems to me that in the judgment of a thing or a person, pseudo-intellectuals are more in their own interests and no profit as the standard, the real intellectuals stand on a healthy society commonly recognized value standards to judge." Intellectuals have never been more depraved. "

About Li Wenliang
Don't keep thinking about "She Xiaojia, for everyone"
   On the day the hospital announced Dr. Li Wenliang's death, Yu Minhong wrote in his diary:
"My heart fell to the bottom, lost my soul, the heart was filled with grief and pain, a person locked in the study, crying for half an hour,
He then posted a tweet:
Here, I express my deep condolences to Dr. Li Wenliang of Wuhan City Center Hospital. He was one of the eight first doctors to be admonished. I hope his early cry and precious life will not be paid in vain. Here to borrow Mr. Lu Xun's poem to place my condolences to Dr. Li Wenliang: how much pride as the old, flowers flowering and falling from two. What period of tears sprinkled Jiangnan rain, but also for the people crying athletes. Mr. Li Wenliang is laid to rest! "
Why did Dr. Li Wenliang's death touch the hearts of so many people?
The grief was not only because of Dr. Lee's death, but because of a plague that could have been prevented, which could have been eliminated in a small extent, and which turned into a national disaster.
Dr. Li Wenliang is really just ordinary people like you and me. As can be seen from the admonition, he was also afraid when confronted by the police, admitting that he was a "disinformation" and writing down the word "understand". If the outbreak does not break out, then his "disinformation" will be sit on the table, which will most likely affect his future work and promotion.
This matter, let everyone see the lack of tolerance of speech. A society must need a certain degree of speech tolerance, in order to let the real information spread faster, so that everyone's suspicion is reduced, accelerate social transparency, stability and development.
So, how do you tell who is the real rumor-monger and liar?
It is clearly not enough to rely on an official channel to distinguish. It's like planning the country's economy through a planned economy, and it's hard to implement it. To improve the resolution of rumors and lies, the most important is three channels:The first is to enhance the credibility of the government to do things and the credibility of the media, so that the people of the country believe that what the government says and what the public media say is reliable and credible; , keep the procedure fair, not an administration department, without knowing the situation, to make its own decisions.
Looking back, we would rather Li Wenliang Pingping often, living in obscurity, rather than because of the death and become everyone's hero. I believe that Li Wenliang himself will be willing to live ordinary and happy, rather than as a hero to sacrifice.

/*********************************************************************************/

16. The old patriarch had long said: to build a family, and then to govern the world.
Taking care of yourself and your family is to contribute to your country. Don't always think of "She xiaojia, for everyone", there is no small family happiness and well-being, where to everyone's Guotai Min'an?
After Dr. Li Wenliang's death, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, said a fair word:
"The city of Wuhan does owe an apology to Li Wenliang. The principals of Wuhan and Hubei also owe a solemn apology to the people of Hubei and the whole country. Why didn't the principal officials in Wuhan go to pay their respects to Li Wenliang during his illness, and why didn't they overturn his attitude earlier? Is it so hard for our government and officials to do something wrong and bow to the wronged humanity? "

About Business
Employees are hair, business is leather
The skin does not exist, the hair will be attached
According to Yu Minhong's diary, this outbreak has also brought a severe test to the New Oriental:
Ground classes are completely suspended, millions of winter vacation classes students can not attend classes, if all refund, The New Oriental can only close the door, 780,000 teachers and employees' livelihood, immediately become a problem. So Yu Minhong temporarily decided to move the classroom online, so that willing students can attend classes at home.
But this transformation is not easy, first of all, New Oriental's online system is not ready, second, New Oriental teachers mostly do not have online teaching experience, and then parents and students are willing to take classes online is also a problem.
But in any case, it's better to change than to sit back and wait. Chinese New Year's Eve tens of thousands of teachers began online training, all the technicians and research and development staff around the clock finally ready for the online system.
But on January 31st, the seventh day of the new Oriental line, the server was hit by a fierce external attack, leaving many students unable to attend classes.
That day, Yu Minhong wrote in his "Epidemic Diary":
I would also like to say to the hackers here, at this critical moment when everyone needs to help each other, the whole Chinese people are united in the difficult times, I do not care why you attack the New East, it is not appropriate.
People do things to have the bottom line and consensus, if there is no bottom line to do things, the last mutual evil will be more and more, the living environment will be more and more poor.
On February 1st, the third day of online classes, parents questioned in the interactive group: Since it's online classes, why not give them free or slash prices?
Yu Minhong's reply, said the outbreak of countless enterprises under the helplessness:
I want to say it really can't do wow. This outbreak has actually raised, not decreased, the cost of all training institutions. Classes cannot be opened in the classroom, rent is paid, teachers' salaries are paid, and after the classroom moves to the online system, there is a large additional system operating expenses. If the online classes are free, New Oriental basically lasts less than 3 months on the smoke.
This is also the New Oriental, a Minhong said that "is a bit of a home base" of listed companies, not to mention other small and medium-sized enterprises.
Think that if a large number of private enterprises can not survive this disaster, china's economy, employment, development, the impact and harm may be greater than the new crown lung itself. If the employment of employees is Mao, then thousands of enterprises are leather, skin does not exist, Mao will be attached?
There are rumors on the Internet that Wang Jianlin proposed that all Wanda Plaza, are exempt from tenants for a month's rent, do not know whether this matter is true. If true, that is the example of Chinese entrepreneurs.
08
About the role
When you start a career
is to give his own life to it.
As an entrepreneur, Yu Minhong keeps a diary detailing some of his actions and what New Oriental did during the outbreak:
On January 25, Wuhan New Oriental School announced that new Oriental winter and spring classes would be open to medical workers' children in Hubei free of charge, on January 26th, New Oriental donated 20 million yuan to the Hubei Red Cross, and on January 27th, the winter vacation classes of the New Oriental School were open to medical personnel' children from all over the country free of charge. At the same time, New Oriental offers 1.5 million free spring online classes and 200,000 free online courses for foreign-speaking spoken language.
"I was on New Year's Day, To take my family abroad on vacation, if you go abroad can also not come back. But as the first person in charge of the New Oriental, how can I throw tens of thousands of teachers and managers at home regardless of their own to go far? In the SARS period I have been adhered to in the first line, 17 years later today, I still must adhere to the first line to lead all the New Oriental struggle.
When you start a career, you give your own life to the cause, no matter what happens, you have no reason and excuse to leave the cause, otherwise it is a betrayal of the cause. So in the face of any challenge, you will have to go to the soup fire, righteous, this will also be China's generation of private entrepreneurs fate. "
In special times, how should a company be a responsible company? A passage by Cao Dewang, chairman of Fuyao Glass, can be compared with Yu Minhong's remarks:　
"Which company has more than three months' carry money?" Our entire enterprise budget, the funds are to control within three months, turnover days are generally 100 to 120 days, three months is normal. It's your business to stay for three months, and the business must help itself. "
09
About the international community
Chinese seems to have been in the habit of destruction.
Feel that you won't come without smashing the old one
In his diary, Yu Minhong makes two very elaborate metaphors for the international community's assistance to China and conspiracy theories under the outbreak. One is the metaphor of an axe, the other is the metaphor of a neighbor:
People's mentality is very interesting, many people will fall into the loss of axeand and steal the axe mentality. When you lose an axe and you think someone stole it, you look at that person like a man who steals an axe, and when you find the axe, you don't look like a man who steals an axe.
Some people think that anything in the United States will be a conspiracy against China, so how to see how the Americans are engaged in conspiracy, and others think that Americans do everything right is good, but not.
The United States is a country, the country has the interests and demands of the country, so the United States may do things against China for the sake of interest, but the same thing the United States may also do to China's advantage, because it is also good for them. This time the U.S. drug opened to China, personally think it is a humanitarian act, there is no conspiracy not to plot.
In the age of globalization, helping each other is also helping themselves. We'd better not get caught up in what others do is malicious, only that we are a noble mode of thinking.
There are reports that 84 countries have imposed restrictions on Chinese entry. So the Internet is a scolding, said that usually from China to get a lot of benefits, but the key moment to China to abandon.
In fact, this is an overreaction approach, we make a simple metaphor to understand:
If your neighbor has an infectious disease, will you allow your neighbor to enter and leave your house freely? Just because you don't allow access doesn't mean you're not friendly to your neighbors, just to better protect your family. At the same time, this does not prevent you from continuing to give the neighbors medicine end water, ask the cold ask warm?
We see countries that are barred from entering the Chinese, many of whom are constantly sending supplies to China, and many who express their condolences to the Chinese people. Is this a truth to the neighbor relationship mentioned above?
We should look at these problems more rationally. Rational thinking makes us stronger and more integrated into the world. Most of the world's problems are economic and moral, and from these two perspectives, perhaps we can see more clearly what the relationship is all about.
Why so, these two days there is a picture widely circulated on the Internet.
On the material box donated by the Japanese dancing crane to Dalian, two poems were written: Aoyama with the clouds and rain, and the moon was once two townships. The last time Japan sent Wuhan on the material box on it: mountains and rivers exotic, wind moon the same day.
It has to be said that Japan's preservation and application of traditional culture is better than China's. Japan was fully westernized after the Meiji Restoration, but Japan's total westernization did not come at the expense of the elimination of traditional culture, but did its best to keep both. In Japan, thousands of years of ancient temples, ancient cities, has been very well preserved, more than a hundred years of enterprises also have more than 60,000.
On the other handChinese seems to have a habit of destruction. Feel that if you don't break the old one, the new one won't come.
From the beginning of the xiangyu burning Aroome Palace, to the May 4th Movement shouted "down the hole shop", to today's demolition of ancient buildings, it seems that has not stopped.
Why isn't it worth our reflection?
10
About life
Life's Memoir
Is it pale and powerless to empty content, or the heart of the tide of tears
It depends on how you write today.
In his diary, Yu Minhong wrote the story of a friend of a friend:
I have a friend of mine who spent four years in prison because of some problems, and while other prisoners were living like each other, he recited most of the words in the Oxford Double Dictionary and learned english at a high level. After his release from prison, he used his English skills to travel most of the world and translated several English books.
Life, all the time, can be prepared for the future. Life is wonderful, we more or less can control their own.
Under the outbreak, snails live at home, what exactly should we do, Yu Minhong's words are quite enlightening.
The French writer Moposan also said:
Life can't be as good as you think, but it won't be as bad as you think. I think people are more fragile and strong than they can imagine. Sometimes I may be so weak that I burst into tears in one sentence, and sometimes I find myself gritting my teeth for a long time.
After the outbreak, we really have a long way to go.
These days there is a photo on the Internet fire, a patient in the square cabin hospital bed carefully read. He read Fukuyama's "The Origin of the Political Order: From the Former Human Age to the French Revolution", and after the photo went on fire, the author of the book, the American scholar Francis Fukuyama, retweeted the news on Twitter.
This picture let me see a beam of light, a beam of not willing to be subdued by disease, and fate of the light.
How difficult life is, we must, on the one hand, go ahead, and do our best on the other.
Heavenly, is that we do not have to think every day when will die, self-scare themselves; Our life, both to prepare for tomorrow may not be in, but also to do a good job may live to a hundred years old reserves. These are two completely different mindsets.
On the one hand, we must make every day better, because life is made up of every day. If every day is bad, it is a lifetime of bad. Every day is good, essentially full of two content, one is to live in the present, so that today's day is rich and happy. The other is to prepare for the future, because the probability is that you will live a long time.
Today we should not indulge in the loss and pain of the past, and we should not let the negative energy accumulated in the past affect our sday today. The things that hold us behind our feet today, the ones that should kick off and kick off. There are always people who like to hold on to their wounds, and there are always people who are crushed by failure because they are so focused on yesterday.
Today's sun rises, should be a new beginning, the heart of sadness, must be left to yesterday.
On the other hand, we must be today. If things are not done today, it will become a burden of tomorrow, even to tomorrow's quality of life. Even animals know that for the winter to reserve food, human high-ability lies in the ability to reserve resources for a lifetime. For example, when we go to college, we are actually trying to reserve knowledge and ability for a lifetime.
The happiest people are those who can combine today and tomorrow, and the most successful people are the ones who love what they do today and reserve resources for tomorrow.
Life is fickle, not to do things erratic.
Life must look forward to the future, and strive for the future, because most people will live a life of peace, spend a long time, always do more for themselves and the world. But none of us can predict whether tomorrow will no longer belong to ourselves. So we have to learn to live in the present, appreciate the beauty we encounter, treat us well, treat our loved ones, treat everyone we meet.
Our life is a memoir. When you're old, this memoir may be the only one you can read. When you read, is pale and weak, empty content, or heart, tears, completely depends on how you start today.
Dickens wrote a famous quote at the beginning of "The Tale of Two Cities":
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times; it was the year of wisdom, it was the year of ignorance; it was the time of faith, it was the time of doubt; it was the season of light, it was the dark season; it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of disappointment.
This phrase is especially relevant to describe the present.
In such a short period of time, we have encountered "ignorance, doubt, darkness and disappointment" and "wisdom, faith, light and hope".
Finally, I would like to use a passage from Yu Minhong's diary, as the end of this article, to send you:
Go out for a walk at night and find the sky star shining and half a month hanging in the middle of the sky. Through the head of the willow branch, look at the half-month lyme, feel as if there are countless hands holding a round of light.

17. "Difficult and difficult, Yu Yucheng - a letter to all the students in the five classes"
Original Xu Li QHFZC1805
Dear children:
In the days of the epidemic, I've been trying to tell you something, but I don't know where to start. Remember that on the night of Chinese New Year's Eve, we were playing dumplings in the class group, red envelopes, and the happy atmosphere was suddenly interrupted by a message - the first medical teams from all over the country to assist Wuhan set off. So the mood suddenly became heavy, and this sinking to this day.
The last time the country faced a major outbreak of SARS, I was also a student. Looking back on that time, time seemed a little fuzzy, only remember to call the teacher every morning to report the temperature, remember to look out of the window the whole street is empty. Then, for a long time, that memory was buried.
Today, the current outbreak, it turns out that that memory may have been buried by the entire nation and the whole country.
Recently, the internet for the new pneumonia the whole incident of loopholes, negligence, lag, there is no shortage of verbal abuse, so I do not want to repeat anything. But I hope that every child, I hope you, will be able to think deeply about this event.
Humans are by no means advanced species. We always say that man is a high-class creature, but history has proved time and time again that we are pale and weak in the face of nature. So I thought, should the word "advanced" be redefined? Its abuse confuses too many people's minds, making them unbridled and inausable. Including in the epidemic has been raging today, those who refuse to isolate, violence against the law, make a fortune, because of self-righteous, feel that they can stay out of the way or even to influence the situation. What's the difference between these people, and those who initially did not do anything that caused the spread of the epidemic? I often say to you that if a man has no fear at all, then that person will go astray, for there is no longer anything in the world that can be bound to him. So, I think, humans this species can be called rich, but not superior. Only when we are aware of this can we define our position and our posture.
Second, every era needs heroes. In the "Night Reading Whisper" to everyone recommended "when the human stars shine", I have said: since ancient generosity is easy, calmly to death. There are no saints in the world who are unselfish and fearless, but some people make a more noble choice in front of their own desires, so there are "heroes" in the world. Any era requires a man of generosity, and any era requires someone to carry the burden. Today, all those who are on the front line know that special drugs have not yet been discovered, and that high infection rates mean that going to the front line is life and death. But they made a hard but firm decision. So whether it's the medical staff or the security guards at the door of your neighborhood, they're heroes. Every life is fragile, but these people know what they can't do, but they still have to do it, because they realize that their flesh and blood are the last line of defense in this country.
Third, the national difficulties, but also to do the best of their own. Over time, how many students have been immersed in the excitement of a long vacation and do nothing. Many students will say: teacher we have nothing to do ah! Students, do you remember to give up on the grounds of academic stress? Some students gave up painting, some students gave up writing, some students gave up to practice words ... Now, time has come, where are you? If you can't do it at this point, don't use "no time" as an excuse later. So, please calm down and use this time to polish yourself.
Since the outbreak, I've been reflecting. Seventeen years ago, when SARS struck and became a generational pain, the whole country and nation were determined: history must not be allowed to repeat itself. But 17 years later, in the face of a new type of pneumonia, what progress have we made? The medical development that man is most proud of has shown no advantage in this campaign. On the contrary, excessive "self" leads to greater risks to the movement of people, local institutions greedy for private desire to disrupt the market, gossip is full of panic.
Dear children, in the face of the facts, I have to say with guilt: our generation has not done well, at least not good enough. The pain of history has not allowed us to fully learn our lesson. But, not good enough, we will use our own meager efforts to make up for the mistakes made, to protect the weak you, to cure this ailing country. At the same time, we would like to hope that you, who have experienced this pain, will not be as helpless as we are today in the future. Today's mistakeises not only the mistakes of others, but also the immaturity of a generation. So, I hope you can grow up, pull the whole nation, no longer in the historical cycle of the opportunity to miss the opportunity.
Difficult and difficult, Yu Yucheng. It's always bright, but we don't know how long the night is.

18. The Silent Spiral and Crisis Public Relations of Director Gao Fu and Director Wang Yanxuan
Original Master Personality
Master Wen
Who are our enemies in the "epidemic war"? Who's our friend?
Fortunately, two days ago, the Supreme Inspection sent a special text to make this matter clear.
It emphasizes:
Do not act, dare not to assume, the reaction numbness, style floating, perfunctory blame, push and pull, fraud, dereliction of duty and so on bureaucracy, formalism, is our enemy!
Put this words in front of this article, is convenient to read later, compared to the inspection!
The current situation is very serious! The number of confirmed persons today is nearly 60,000, and the number of new diagnoses in Wuhan is nearly 15,000.
Hubei made a major appointment and removal today.
Documents published in some places have been directly referred to as "wartime status orders".
Here's a common sense:
Wartime state, the front of the full force to kill the enemy, the rear of the grasp of adultery. The objectives are the same and their roles are complementary.
The rear rape, can not be separated from the folk supervision.
So, who is to blame for this, when things get to this point?
Don't you blame the soldiers ahead for not trying so hard enough to die? Do you blame the lack of rear support, the quality of the civilian population is not high?
The strongman died in the sand, the people tears wet clothes, they are worthy of tribute!
In the final analysis, the rhythm is some of the faint officials, experts and so on to bring bad!
To say that it is difficult to hear, these people, that is, to "rape" the object.
Of course, this is not the past, with the word "twisted", sharp gas heavy. Let it be changed to "except" and let them eliminate from the eyes, how far and far.
The word "treacherous" is also not good to hear. Whatever the phrases, people hate contempt - adulterers, treacherous, adulterous, treacherous, rape, adultery, treachery, treachery, treachery, treachery. . . It's not good anyway, it's not a good thing.
In fact, in the face of the epidemic, some unconscious officials, experts, miskilled people, is not a good person, and did not do any good things.
In the age of civilization, "exonlyagain" could not be used with a gun, but had to be justified.
So, don't put all the "keyboard man" wrong.
The great man, for the country for the people. As long as it is axiom, justice, there is value of existence.
Besides, the people are now the most reliable backstage, must have the Internet.
The keyboard is also a life-saving knife in the hands of the people.
Who are our enemies in the war?
In fact, the hearts of ordinary people have rod scales!

Controversy and suspected PR involved
Who is the official, the common people dare not say more, can not say more.
A lot of things are complicated, can't see clearly, can't tell, but also easy to get into trouble.
Mr. Lu Xun's true meaning of "beating down the dog" is of great value to the research of rediscovery.
Today to say, it is the concentration of some experts and scholars, "official learning" amphibious star.
The spotlight shines on the brightest two people, one is the director of the Central Disease Control Bureau - Gao Fu academician, one is the director of the Wuhan virus - Ms. Wang Yanxuan.
These two men are being beaten in groups! Specific ally why being beaten and scolded, everyone went to the Internet to check, a lot of mammoth. A lot of details, here is not to be laid out.
For the convenience of the following reasoning, only the relevant plot to do the following summary:
Controversy involving academicians:
1, whether suspected of underreporting. On January 30, the Senior Academy published a signed paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, which was deduced by netizens that he might have known the truth about the virus";
2, did not clarify the correction. As the director of the Central Disease Control, the first group of expert sons and staff said the outbreak "preventable and controllable" and other arguments, netizens think he should have the relevant right to know, but failed to speak out;
3, write a thesis to make a speech to pursue fame and profit. Netizens think that in the critical time of disease prevention, as the director of disease control, not to write the paper on the battlefield, but a number of papers to engage in speech, and even to Fan Bingbing to find brokers how to sell learning.
4, last year related remarks hit the face. "I am confident that 'SARS-like incidents' will not happen again because our infectious disease surveillance network is well-built and this kind of incident will not happen again," Gao fu said on March 4, 2019, according to the Evening Standard. Now it's a laughing stock.
......
Suspected PR of The Fellow of Gaofu:
1, in the face of the paper is not open to the truth question, Gaofu responded that the paper is a "retrospective paper" as the reason, cage and all avoid whether to know the virus "human transmission" truth, as well as write the details of the paper.
2, is suspected to be for the net message deleted post. There is a needle asked GaoFu academician's WeChat article, when the click of more than 10 million was deleted, the author continued to report that the whistleblower is believed to be "fabricating facts, casually stigmatizing the country to contribute to the scientists, seriously damage the reputation of others."
3, Gaofu silence.
......
Controversy involving Wang Yanxuan:
1, "mother of double yellow" problem. At a time when the Chinese people are suffering from the new coronavirus, a "double yellow even oral solution can inhibit the new coronavirus" report, leading out the beauty of Wuhan virus. As one of the leading figures of this great discovery unit, he was named "Mother of Double Yellow Lian" by netizens.
2, "Double Yellow Even Fucking Love" mystery. When Wang Yanxuan was studying the School of Life Sciences of Peking University, he had a teacher-student relationship with Professor Shu Hongbing of the Institute. Since then, the old husband and wife, husband and wife, from Peking University to Wuda, from Beijing to Jiangcheng, admission to the promotion, cross-cutting, suspected in the stage "to help the horse, send to the end" of the good play.
3, the relevant organizational procedures are scientific and reasonable questions. The beauty director from the grass-roots researchers to the official office-level cadres, only six years, behind a series of job changes, whether to withstand the "procedural justice" test.
4, "Rao Yi wrote to Shu Hongbing to persuade his wife to resign" rumors. Net-a-porter famous scholar Rao Yi to Shu Hongbing, advised him to hurry to let Wang Director resign, which said that Wang director is not virology, the level is also poor, the seniority is too low to convince the public, should not affect the development of the Institute. This matter has not been denied by the relevant people, not like a hole to the wind.
5. The material of "a special student of the art of Peking University" which was renamed. There is from the media through the provision of Xi'an Iron I, Peking University, Wuda, Wuhan virus and other units of informative authoritative data materials, judge Wang Yanxuan original name Wang Yan Tie, is an art speciality student, but can not find her candidate of the year, can not find out what kind of special policy admission candidates.
......
Ms. Wang Yanxuan's suspected public relations:
1, Shu Hongbing out of the article, in response to a WChat article about Ms. Wang Yanxuan's "success history", after reading more than 10 million, the network has a picture showing "I am Shu Hongbing, I hope you will immediately delete about Wang Yanxuan and my micro-blogging article, and publicly apologize..." and other strong and threatening content.
2, whether to divert attention from new hot-button issues. Wuhan virus has been followed by a series of disputes around Shi Zhengli team to study whether it is possible to leak, the application for "god medicine" Redwest use patent dispute, so that the "mother of double yellow lian" out of the public eye.
3, positive image publicity quietly exerts strength. China Science Daily published a title entitled "Race with the virus for the protection of life - close to the Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan Virus Research Institute to fight the first line of the epidemic", and by the newspaper and unit of the new media to change the title recommended, through the report and netizens with the message, actively show the Institute's achievements and role in the epidemic war, disguised to Wang Director's face to paste gold.
4, Wang Yanxuan was silent.
......
The above brief list of GaoFu academician and Director Wang Yanxuan involved in disputes and suspected public relations, limited to space, but a simple generalization.
Interested comrades can also be online to collect combing, finishing binding into a book, carefully study.
Speaking of research, let's report on my recent research on "Research on new coronavirus papers".
By sorting through reading a large number of original foreign materials, I now want to praise in advance, in the past two months, Chinese scholars in the new corona virus research results, in a blowout state, published papers, can be called a huge number.
After preliminary study, I also found a series of problems. If I could write a paper, my title would be " Before the outbreak of the virus, the epidemic war is in progress, these experts and scholars lost their face."
0 2
Indifference, arrogance and cunning can only provoke public opinion.
This article mainly focuses on the public opinion problems that Gao Fu and Director Wang Yanxuan are currently experiencing, as well as their related responses, to talk about the crisis public relations issue.
It is not particularly terrible for academic officials to fall into an image crisis. I've seen House of Cards and know how important it is to put out a fire.
It has to be said that, so far, in the face of public opinion, Gao Fu and Wang Yanxuan's performance is very unqualified.
Your attitude, for public opinion tracking, is probably the driving force.
Your silence, for public opinion, is likely to be a provocation.
Perhaps what you believe in is the theory of the silent spiral. Feel that the truth is in the hands of a few of your top elites, unwilling to express themselves, and fearing retaliation or isolation from the concentration of public opinion.
In fact, this session of the common people is the most generous, the most merciful. There have been too many facts over the years that some officials really don't deserve such a good people.
When they encounter cold hunger, a cry of sympathy for a piece of bread, is warm mother, when they enter a life-and-death situation, a few officials were dismissed, several new officials left office, immediately cheered "the government has a tall man."
In front of such a great people, not good at crisis public relations to relieve public opinion, it is really sad, pathetic, hateful!
Like Gao Fu, Wang Yanxuan, such as the people who rolled into the vortex of public opinion, may feel that they are also wronged, is back pot, which is actually caught in a serious misunderstanding of self-judgment.
When the people are suffering, it is too much to ask you more questions, a few more points of supervision, and a few more requests?
Gao Fu and Wang Yanxuan's present performance, in a sense, set acoldatic, arrogant, cunning in one.
Touch fish in the water in a silent manner; don't use "casual slurs" "What the hell do you want to do?" "Such power discourse, to give people a hat, pressure, by diverting attention and praise reporting, pull more people together to avoid washing the ground.
All these, are false and inferior ugly line, absolutely can not play any effective role in public relations.
Because, in the internet age, when you don't put a power hat on, public opinion can pick up your last leggings.
And don't blindly self-confidence in the hands of that point of power.
Power is all given by the people, and the people can take it back in the name of the people.
0 3
Rather than crisis PUBLIC relations, not silent spiral
So, what kind of crisis public relations does Gao Fu and Wang Yanxuan need?
Here are two things I say:
The first point is to do three things in front of the people - sincerity, sincerity, sincerity, or sincerity of his mother.
Really do and true, let people feel good, hate away, things may be over.
Gao Fu and Comrade Wang Yanxuan are not sincere enough at present.
Gaofu with a "retrospective paper" to respond to the "prefer to send papers, not the truth" rumors, giving the impression that people into more difficult discourse discussion difficulties, forcing people to explain many concepts and processes. This kind of behavior, really unkind.
My suggestion is that Mr. Gao Fu should play to his academic advantages, as an academic bull who has published four or five hundred SCI papers, you are fully capable of doing a paper on this, you research the new corona virus and write the paper, write clearly, show well.
For example, for the research diary, the daily progress of the epidemic, participating scholars and officials, epidemic prevention treatment report, etc. to carry out list statistics, at the same time, your writing paper input time, contribution process, related content, delivery cycle, etc., also to compare the list, make a database, layout eye-catching, easy to verify.
Similarly, Wang Yanxuan can also put his own reading time and place (including study abroad), the marital status of husband and wife, job title assessment process, administrative level promotion procedures to make a full report, to achieve data and visualization, to provide public opinion inspection, to eliminate public opinion doubts.
Ms. Wang Yanxuan's most insincere performance is suspected husband Shu Hongbing jumped out. Such a thing would be unwise and would only fuel public opinion. This aspect should also be made clear.
It is often reminded that this may involve the privacy of others yo!
Look, now people are not only kind and kind, but also particularly fond of defending the rights of these questioned officials. What a kind people!But don't forget that, unlike ordinary people, public officials, who disclose part of their privacy, are themselves a necessity for effective oversight of power.
Not sincere is the most terrible, is blind arrogance, self-view is very high. Therefore, I am advised that no more to put gold on their own face, let alone move out of the power to threaten public opinion.
The second point is to do three things before the people - the truth, the truth, the truth, or the truth of his mother.
With the outbreak exposed a variety of bureaucracy, formalism, now above can not look down, the introduction of such four words - realistic.
To be realistic is to have the truth.
Don't blame the common people staring at you, the bottom line and logic of criticism is that not only not afraid to treat the people with the greatest goodwill, but also not afraid to speculate on some officials with the greatest malice.
This is not what Lu Xun said!
For Director Wang Yanxuan, the most urgent thing at hand is the double yellow lotus this Big Wulong case, Wuhan virus in the end how to intervene, as the gatekeeper is how to manage. You can't be silent about such a plunder ingress of billions of dollars!
For The academician gaofu, even if you do not say what is at hand, but also to say that last year he said with confidence that "'SARS-like incidents' will not appear again" of the face-punching incident. In the face of the current outbreak of the fate of hundreds of millions of people, you should not be silent!
The truth needs to be told, there are too many!
Crisis public relations most taboo bypass, not to face the problem directly. Netizens care about what, must say what.
Some people say that "explanation is cover-up". Wrong. That's because the attitude of the explanation is not sincere enough, and the explanation is not convincing enough.
In important moments, important positions, if not to present sincerity and truth to the public, it will naturally lead to greater consternation, misreading, anger.
The story of "House of Cards" shows that, no matter how to put out the fire, there is a consensus in Washington that there is a sense of abandonment of confrontation and candidness.
In good faith, this is the starting point and foundation of crisis public relations.
Presenting the truth is the key and support of crisis pr.
Or that sentence, there is no truth, there is no justice!
There is no truth, can not prove their innocence!
All the happiness is out of struggle, no one wants to struggle on the road to encounter the hidden rules and stumbling blocks.
That is why people will make crisis public relations for GaoFu academician and Director Wang Yanxuan, fully waiting, full of expectations.
Another sincere reminder, the silent spiral can sometimes be involved in the black hole, crisis public relations can sometimes let people usher in the willow.
It's not just about your two lives and your destiny, it's about people's trust and confidence in more fields.
Because, in this world, no one who wants to stand next to him can only be an imaginary enemy.

19. Revisiting the Use of Public Chopsticks
You know I know that.
Author: Renwen Liu
Hu Yaobang's daughter, Manmei, revealed in her book", "Missing Still Endless——— Recalling Father Hu Yaobang" that as early as 1984, Hu Yaobang, then general secretary of the Communist Party of China(CPC) Central Committee, proposed to abolish unhygienic eating methods, but at that time many people difficult to understand, including family members. Years later, when she saw a report by Australian medical experts that Chinese suffered from ulcer disease in high proportion because Chinese used to sharing a container for meals, and that the bacteria in saliva were spread through chopsticks to food and infected each other, she lamented: "If we had adopted my father's initiative more than a decade ago, Do today's Chinese need to suffer from ulcer disease in such a high proportion? "
A quarter of a century later, Hu Yaobang's initiative has not materialized. Remember that in 2003 SARS, the Chinese people had been popular for a period of time to use public chopsticks, but the outbreak, "co-food" and come back.
A few days earlier, Professor Li Ben, director of the Center for Chinese Law Studies at Columbia University, also raised the question: China attaches so much importance to the prevention of swine flu (H1N1), why not promote the use of public chopsticks among the whole population?
I took this question to my colleagues and suggested that we should also use public chopsticks for future dinners. One of the colleagues said, in fact, we now feast foreign guests, generally use public chopsticks, but the Chinese people's own dinner, not so pay attention. Another colleague said, thousands of years of habits, now to change, how easy to talk about? Another female colleague said that she also has the habit of hygiene, but not good to ask people to use chopsticks, had to catch dishes when looking at the plate where others have not moved.
In your chopsticks I a chopsticks "co-food system", the use of public chopsticks people are looked at in the other eye. One of my friends is a hepatitis patient, he once attended a dinner when he consciously used public chopsticks, but at the end of the day, see other people's eyes, there is an invisible pressure. He also said, if some people do not consciously, or do not want to expose themselves, not also can not be divided? But he felt that it was not up to his conscience to do so. Inspired by him, I think that if everyone uses public chopsticks, people like him will not be under pressure.
In addition to customers are not used to using public chopsticks, restaurants also lack this service. Last week, the author in a restaurant near the unit, dinner before the two French scholars and accompanying their embassy officials, I remind the waiter several times, please give us each dish to a pair of public chopsticks, each with soup on the last public spoon, the result of the waiter is also a pair, to the end I am also embarrassed to urge again, had to use public chopsticks.
There is no doubt that the traditional "co-food" is neither hygienic nor civilized. A plate of vegetables, a pot of soup, everyone chopsticks one stretch in, you come to me, although lively, but also the bacteria and viruses passed on to others. More people to express enthusiasm and hospitality, often with their own chopsticks to stir the seasoning of vegetables and to others sandwich, so that those accustomed to using public chopsticks do not know what to do. Data show that china's stomach disease patients, every 10 people have 6 people are Helicobacter pylori carriers, the transmission of the way is the habit of multi-person mixed meals. It can be seen that "co-eating" can spread disease is not alarmist.
The author is not said to thoroughly Chinese food and dining style, changed to western food of the kind of per person per person, on the contrary, the Chinese food culture pay attention to the advantages of lively atmosphere is worth retaining, but the implementation of the public chopsticks public spoon system is imperative. In fact, Chinese restaurants abroad have already transformed their dining methods——— with one or two spoons on each dish' plate. With the Olympic Games in Beijing and the upcoming World Expo in Shanghai, China's restaurant industry image and culture will be further displayed on the international stage. I hope that our catering industry will actively explore and guide the people to change the "co-food system" this bad way of eating, the community has come to pay renewed attention to and call for the implementation of the public chopsticks public spoon system.

20. "Such disinfection is not only useless!" And harmful! 》
Healthy Hubei
The following article is from Shanghai Disease Control, author Shanghai Disease Control
Shanghai Disease Control
Introduce vaccination, AIDS counseling testing, tuberculosis treatment, health check-up, health evaluation testing information. Spread health knowledge on infectious diseases, chronic diseases, food/nutrition/environment/occupational/radiation hygiene, and disseminate knowledge of prevention and control of major infectious disease outbreaks, information on major health services and work dynamics. Promote the common sense of healthy living, conduct public surveys and feedback.
Recently, with the arrival of the return peak and the resumption of business, many communities, enterprises, office space, street, etc. there is excessive disinfection phenomenon.
The following figure, actually to all the people entering the community, enterprises, offices spray disinfection.
Spray disinfection
___ _
For example, large-scale disinfection of roads, greening, air, street roads, etc. in the district.
Such a move, seemingly reassuring,
But from a scientific and health point of view,
Is it safe? Is it reasonable?
Here's the answer.
I. "Who's the enemy, who's the friend?"
Where should --- disinfect?
"Where there are patients, there's a virus."
The main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses are through respiratory droplets and contact. Therefore, if the new coronavirus pollution of the community, enterprises, office space and street, the probability is in the patient's droplets can reach or hand frequent contact, and is conducive to the virus retention of the site or place. Such as: door handle, doorbell button, elevator button, elevator car, stair handrails, patients stay indoor environment. These parts and locations can be disinfected as needed.
And outdoor environment, greening, roads and so on, because of air circulation, ultraviolet light and other factors, is not conducive to the survival of the new coronavirus, generally do not need disinfection.
Second, prohibit the use of disinfection channels in communities and enterprises, the basis for large-area disinfection of the streets
According to the new coronavirus transmission characteristics have been mastered, the current prevention and control phase should resolutely prohibit the establishment of disinfection channels in the community, enterprises, office space and other entrances, resolutely prohibit the street to carry out large-scale disinfection!
The reasons are as follows:
There are relevant technical documents, chemical disinfectant spraying can not directly large-area action on the human body;
Spray chemical disinfectant, may cause eye, skin irritation, inhalation pneumonia, skin inflammation, allergic reactions, etc. , serious will lead to the recurrence of chronic bronchitis in the elderly, asthma attacks in children;
Spray disinfection, need to completely spray the whole body and act for a period of time, a short time through the spray channel without disinfection effect.
The use of channels to spray (gonort) disinfection of the human body is generally used in biological terrorist attacks and other events;
The general public daily out, the whole body is less likely to be contaminated with the virus, there is no need for whole body disinfection.
In short, in addition to leading to human stimulation and disease, pollution of the environment, waste of human and material resources, leading to panic, for the prevention and control of the epidemic is not a little benefit!
Say it again.
New crown pneumonia current prevention and control stage, generally do not need to outdoor air, greening, road disinfection! Do not need to use disinfection channels to spray disinfection of the human body!
All communities, enterprises, office slots and other places do not take such unreasonable disinfection way Oh!

21. "Wuhan hundred-step pavilion million family banquet, is the capital enterprise in the grass Kan life"
Original Chapter North Sea Zhang North Sea Natural Selection

_
Boiled beans to burn bean bean
Beans sobbing in the kettle
Ben is the same root.
Why is it too urgent to fry
Hundred Steps Pavilion
Ten thousand feasts
The 100-step pavilion was once the most dazzling case of innovative community governance in Wuhan. In 2004, the mega-community was reviewed by state leaders.
In 2009, according to the Yangtze River News, Wanjia banquet has been widely concerned by the news media, CCTV for several years tracking the coverage of Xinhua News Agency, People's Day, Guangming and other central media annual coverage.
The 2020 Feast is the twenty-second full year of the 100-year-old, and for the past 20 years, there has been a force to sustain it until an epidemic breaks the emperor's new clothes.
Of the 55 buildings in Anjuyuan, 33 have fever patients, and in 36 buildings in Lily Court, 17 have fever patients.
Heat notice in Anjuyuan
The hundred-step pavilion itself is not a normal organization.
In China's administrative division system, the smaller level of units than the district is the street, the street office is responsible for the grass-roots residents of most organizations, such as grass-roots culture, funeral, and mediation and so on.
But the hundred-step pavilion has no street, such a large area of 130,000 people, the population is equivalent to a county.
And this population of up to a county community, directly in control of the Parkiting Group, a capital enterprise inside.
Parkway Pavilion Group
Trade and real estate
There is not a civil service establishment in the entire administrative structure and the top levels are staffed by the Parkhead Group. Community committees, management committees, neighborhood committees, property companies and owners' committees are actually full of the same class of horses.
It also represents the grass-roots government, also represents the self-government organization, also represents the interests of the owners, but in the end it is a capital enterprise.
Never before the unity brought about by the unprecedented control ability, hundred-step pavilion community honor got a basket, can take the award once, the national advanced organization, the national red flag unit, the national standard soldier, all non-toxic community ...
But a bout of pneumonia lifted the veil of the farce.
The hundred-step pavilion can organize its own activities
Distribution of honors
although it's a business
According to the information that can be found, the actual controller of the Parktoping Group, that is, the highest leader of the community, is the chairman of the company's board of directors Mao Yonghong.
Mao Yonghong, who engaged in real estate development in the 1990s, was not only satisfied with building houses and selling houses, but also directly used the company's name to form properties and neighborhood committees to participate in community management.
In this group of hundreds of thousands of people, all power goes to the hundred-step pavilion enterprises, not to the people.
It is this enterprise that has caused the tragedy of this year's hundred-step Pavilion.
Mao Yonghong
The actual controller of the hundred-step pavilion
The Economic Observer reported that before the wanfamily banquet was held, the community grass-roots staff to the superior leadership of the views, reconsider whether the Wanjia banquet held as scheduled, but the views were not adopted, 10,000 family banquet as scheduled.
As a result, you also see that large-scale cross-infection, hundred-step pavilion into the epidemic cloud.
So why should the leaders of the Hundred-Step Pavilion community insist on a million feasts? Why not pay attention to the views of grass-roots staff?
Chutian Metropolis Daily front-page headline
There was a whole number of national scoldings.
The reason is that The Parkstand is a private enterprise, and if you want to maintain your privileges, you have to do everything you can to play.
The most basic common sense, when there are infectious diseases, the official has not denied the transmission of people, there should not be mass mass gathering, which is tantamount to the death of a grass- Kan.
But the hundred-step pavilion must engage in a million family banquet, this is its lifeline, do not mean that they fall to the altar, do not do it means that they are not good enough, do not engage in their own private enterprises can not maintain the legitimacy of power.
Without doing, you cannot maintain a state of deformity, Leviathan under a capitalist monopoly.
Praise an official
This is the first time for me.
According to the Economic Observer, there are nearly 40 confirmed and highly suspected cases of a grid of 800 households in the community's Yikangyuan district.
That's eight times higher than the average infection rate in Wuhan.
Light government, heavy enterprises, let the capital take over everything, the management committee, the neighborhood committee, the street, are all hundred-step Pavilion Group employees.
After the government and the party organization retreated, they built, they controlled, they lost control, led the way.
The baxter employees are all private employees.
No organizational leadership
Who serves the people?
In the patient's help zone, you can see the many hundred-step pavilion community's help, which is the result of the capital-controlled hundred-step pavilion. And after the epidemic has expanded, those who have benefited have long since disappeared.
Management committee, neighborhood committee, street, all are the private employees of the Hundred-step Pavilion Group, it is difficult to compare with the grass-roots government should have a sense of responsibility and service.
The out-of-control of the hundred-step pavilion had been doomed from the beginning

There were 9028 suspected cases, 3317 were excluded on the same day, and 6,126 were concentrated in isolation. A total of 158,377 close contacts were tracked and 77,308 were still under medical observation.
What are the new "clinically diagnosed cases" in Hubei Province today's notification? Why add new clinically diagnosed cases?
CCTV reporters exclusive interview with the central guidance group experts, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital Vice President Tong Zhaoxuan.
Tong Chaohui: The fifth version of the health care committee's program has been proposed in Hubei region to clinical diagnosis of cases.
We also have clinical diagnoses in our daily work. When pneumonia is usually diagnosed, the percentage of etopathology is actually only 20 or 30 percent, and 70 percent and 80 percent depend on clinical diagnosis. So this time in Hubei region increased the number of clinically diagnosed cases. Some time ago we mainly rely on nucleic acids for confirmed cases, but in fact there are a large number of suspected cases according to clinical manifestations: have an epidemiological history; Then the clinical characteristics of the examination were carried out, and a comprehensive diagnosis was made after CT imaging.
What is the difference between nucleic acid testing and CT imaging? Which diagnosis is more important?
Tong Zhaoxuan: These are indispensable for clinicians, to do a comprehensive judgment, comprehensive analysis. To consider the relevant nucleic acid tests, but also to analyze CT images. As a respiratory physician, as a clinical critical care physician, we should carefully inquire about the medical history, find clinical clues, the use of modern technology for clinical examination, including this nucleic acid technology. CT imaging is both a radiologist's specialty and a clinician's homehand, and we often see (problems) at a glance. Therefore, to comprehensive analysis, can not emphasize the importance of one.

23. Why has there been a significant increase in the number of new confirmed cases in Hubei today? 》
Ling Fox Cat People's Daily
　　Early in the morning to see the latest announcement in Hubei Province, the number increased significantly.
　　Hubei Update: 14840 new cases, including 13332 clinical diagnoses.
　　Just a day earlier, there were only 1,638 new cases in Hubei, a nearly tenfold increase overnight.
　　Why?
　　In the briefing, there is a note that
　　Recently, Hubei Province has carried out troubleshooting of previous suspected cases and revised the results of the diagnosis, and the new patients are diagnosed according to the new diagnostic classification. In line with the classification of case diagnosis issued by other provinces in the country, from today, Hubei Province will include the number of clinically diagnosed cases into the number of confirmed cases for publication.
　　In accordance with the author's understanding of the situation and understanding, talk about a few points of view.
　　First, the data change sits because the criteria for diagnosis have changed.
　　Previously, whether the patient is diagnosed, the main reference indicator is nucleic acid test results, but also need to combine CT imaging, cough and other symptoms to comprehensively judge.
　　With the deepening of epidemic prevention and control, the accumulation of clinical data, a new situation gradually highlighted
　　Due to the slow time of nucleic acid testing, some patients can not be diagnosed and treated, but the clinical manifestations of the disease are highly suspected of new coronary pneumonia.
　　If we do not change the criteria, this part of the patient will be difficult to get effective relief, the entire outbreak prevention and control also has a negative impact.
　　The main change this time is to include clinical diagnosis in the scope of diagnosis.
　　Second, the data changes reflect the truth-seeking, indicating that "receivables" is accelerating.
　　It is a realistic change to include the number of clinically diagnosed cases in the statistics of confirmed cases.
　　This change is beneficial to the treatment of patients and the prevention and control of the epidemic, and will have a positive impact on accelerating patient admission and accelerating the prevention and control of the epidemic.
　　At the same time, we should also see that the change in the number is mainly reflected in the new classification of confirmed and suspected patients, the total amount of data has not grown rapidly. If the admission is put in place, the relevant data will be quickly reduced.
　　Finally, the epidemic prevention and control has reached the most critical stage, there can not be a trace of slack.
　　Or that sentence, the main is significant, perfunctory not, slack not, retreat not.

25. Four hundred percent
At the beginning of the spread of the epidemic, combined with the actual situation in Jinan, in order to cut off the epidemic in Jinan, Wang Zhonglin after in-depth thinking, put forward the "four hundred percent" idea, that is:
1. 1. 100 percent of the personnel coming to Wuhan and key areas to carry out testing;
2. The early stage has been by Wuhan and key areas to help personnel 100 percent to carry out testing;
3. 100 per cent of the family members of the confirmed cases are under quarantine medical observation;
4. The prevention and control isolation measures for the village, residence and community should be 100 percent landing.
In the outbreak has to expand to rural communities just appeared, Jinan decisively issued the "ten all" provisions:
First, all villages and residences are implemented 24-hour closed management, the village residents into the body temperature testing, no property management to the grid unit to implement closed prevention and control management, foreign personnel and vehicles strictly control access, special circumstances by management personnel to do a good job of registration and record.
2. All citizens will not be door-to-door, do not gather, must wear masks, express delivery, takeaway implementation of contactless distribution.
Third, the provincial foreign relief personnel will be the first time to take the initiative to report to the village, take the initiative to accept temperature measurement, medical observation and other measures.
No training, meetings, entertainment, fitness and other gathering activities shall be held in the enclosed space.
5. No wearing a mask shall be allowed to enter or leave public places such as shopping malls, supermarkets, farmers' markets and stations, and shall not be allowed to use public transport, and all elevators and other small enclosed places in villages shall be subjected to preventive disinfection on a daily basis.
Six, "red thing" all suspended, "white thing" from Jane.
7. The public with fever, cough and other symptoms are the first time to report to the village, must go to the designated hospital fever clinic, strictly prohibited underreporting, underreporting, late reporting.
Eight, housing renters will implement the main responsibility of rental housing management, take the initiative to report to the territorial village housing rental situation.
9. All citizens shall strictly abide by the provisions of the state, province and city on the prevention and control of the epidemic, cooperate with the household registration inspection, and shall not spread rumors, falsely report the epidemic and personal travel and other information.
10. Anyone who violates the provisions on the prevention and control of the epidemic shall be investigated for responsibility in accordance with the law and shall be punished from strict speed.
After arriving in Wuhan, Wang Zhonglin faced a complex and serious situation, the task is also quite heavy. In addition to the numberof confirmed cases and deaths, it can be seen from several speeches by Top Leader Xi Jinping.
On the afternoon of February 10, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the current epidemic prevention and control work is at a critical juncture in the glue-on-the-wall, and that we must persist and resolutely win the Hubei defense war and Wuhan defense war by video link to the Jinyintan Hospital, Concord Hospital and Fire Shenshenshan Hospital in Wuhan City, where patients with new crown pneumonia are treated by video link. Wuhan wins Hubei, Hubei wins, and Hubei wins.
"Wuhan ShengZhe Hubei win, Hubei Sheng is the national victory", how to understand this sentence? In fact, this sentence is very heavy, as long as the reverse push can understand: if "lost", Wuhan is to blame!
Two days later, Xi again chaired a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee to analyze the current situation of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak and study and strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic. The General Secretary stressed at the meeting that
At present, the epidemic prevention and control work to the most exciting critical stage, to do a good job in the epidemic prevention and control focus, strengthen the epidemic is particularly serious or more risk-related areas of prevention and control. Party committees and governments at all levels should, in accordance with the Decision-making and Deployment of the PARTY Central Committee, highlight the key points, take into account, classify guidance and sub-district policies, earnestly grasp the work, grasp the details and grasp the ground, resolutely win the people's war, the overall war and the resistance war of the epidemic prevention and control, and strive to achieve the goal of economic and social development this year.
The meeting stressed that the overall planning of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, is not only a big war, but also a big test. Party committees, governments and leading cadres at all levels should shoulder their responsibilities and be tested, both the courage to assume responsibility and the wisdom of scientific prevention and control, both to take into account the overall planning, and the ability to organize and implement, to effectively grasp the implementation of the work, in the great war to practice the initial mission, in the big examination to hand over qualified answers, to ensure that the people's war, overall war to win the epidemic prevention and control, Stop the war and strive to achieve the goal of economic and social development throughout the year.
Wuhan is certainly one of the "particularly serious or more risky areas", the general secretary said. Therefore, the General Secretary of the above-mentioned requirements, in particular, "both the responsibility to assume the courage, but also scientific prevention and control of wisdom, both overall consideration of the plan, but also the ability to organize the implementation of the organization", not only for the overall requirements of cadres at all levels of the country, but also on the air-dropped Hubei should yong and Wang Zhonglin's advice and expectations.
Those on the brink of death, "fire captains"
This is not the first time that a decisive change of command has been made in a critical moment. For example, 17 years ago, when SARS raged, Wang Qishan was appointed acting mayor of Beijing, such as when He was ordered to be in distress five years ago when Shanxi collapsed and corruption.
Here is Wang Qishan at the time of SARS.
In April 2003, in the most severe period of SARS, only five months of the new Hainan Provincial Party Secretary was on the brink of death, "fire line" north, on behalf of the mayor of Beijing.
The mayor of Qishan is aggressive and flexible. While implementing a strict quarantine system, the outbreak is open.
On the day he took office, he walked into xinfaI Wholesale Market, Chongwenmen Vegetable Market and Wangfujing Pharmaceutical Building to address the shortage of vegetables, side foods and medicine caused by the SARS outbreak.
The next day, the decisive government order, the "SARS" infected people, places in accordance with the law to implement quarantine, cut off the route of infection.
On the third day, the first executive meeting of the municipal government was presided over after taking office, which required all government departments to keep in mind that "there is no drama in the army" on the SARS situation and figures.
When he realized the need to build a dedicated hospital to treat patients, it took only seven days for the modern Xiaotangshan Hospital on the outskirts of Beijing to open.
Later in an interview with CCTV's Face-to-Face column, interviewer Wang Zhi said he agreed very much that it was necessary to control the source of infection, but it was almost impossible to imagine.
There is a very sober, forward-looking understanding of his nail-biting: "No! It is time to make the impossible possible in order to win the war. "
"The measures now, to work for the next ten days, cannot be for that day. If there is now a measure that can be laid down today, the day will be resolved, we are not facing a serious struggle. "
"It's not a question of transparency, it's a matter of social responsibility. We politicians are good, experts are good, can not all day with the public to release, or to the people to release that kind of in case. That's irresponsible, and the spirit of science speaks of probability. "
"You said that tomorrow the hospital is ready for how many beds can be put in, get single digits. It's your responsibility not to make it. This is called no joke, is to increase the degree of organization to the most severe level. "
"The basic functions of the whole city can not be lost - water and coal electrical, commercial, security, sanitation, etc. , should do better than usual. "
At that time, the most impressive media reporters, is his mantra "to tell the truth."
After the victory of SARS, the experience of Wang Qishan, who calls himself "Wang", is well known.
This time, the role of "fire captain" reappeared.
Come on Wuhan!

After the Politburo Standing Committee, Hubei Secretary met overnight to mention "profound reflection" and the next day the leaders of the Red Cross In the Province were held accountable
Exclusive: The doorway led by the Red Cross in Hubei Province
Very period, beijing this leader really dare to say!
Academician: The turning point of the epidemic will soon arrive! National People's Congress response: Wuhan should be authorized to disclose information about the outbreak?
In the face of the outbreak, is the paper important, or human life is important? Is there a conscience?
Wang Qishan: The most important thing is to cut off the source of infection! Completely cut off the source of infection!! Control of the source of infection!!!
Zhong Nanshan more than ten years ago in particular to remind Wuhan and Chinese chrysanthemum bats, why not take it seriously? !

27. "Wuhan Riveting, Horse FartS Roll Away"
Original Yi Zhongtian
Wuhan refueling, does it make sense?
I was not quite in favor of shouting "Wuhan refueling".
Because Wuhan wants not slogans, but real aid.
The pain in their hearts, as Fang Fang said, is also not a slogan can be alleviated.
Besides, Wuhan and Hubei have done their best, where do you want them to refuel?
A gas station in Japan?
So my saying is: Wuhan riveted up.
Riveted, is holding up and sticking to the meaning.
It's like fighting against the flood, riveting on the embankment, people or fish.
Two lines of defense, don't break!
Of course, to shout "Wuhan refueling" is not impossible.
Because the aid has arrived, because the world's attention.
However, I would like to remind you:
Refueling is not equal to adding code!
The first-line medical staff can no longer add code, they have reached the limit.
The first-line grass-roots cadres and the police can not add code, they have also reached the limit.
People are flesh and blood, no one is Transformers.
What to say special materials or steel cast, it is simply grass Kan life!
In fact, now Wuhan, Hubei and even the whole of China, first rely on the first line of medical personnel to treat people, and second, rely on grass-roots cadres and public security police to maintain order, this is our guard home two lines of defense.
If the first line of defense collapses, the corpses are all over the field.
If the second line of defense collapses, the world is in chaos.
So, stop promoting what pregnant nurses, abortion doctors stick to their posts and so on.
That's really a human-blooded hoe!
If you don't, you're going to die?
Cannibal blood steamed bread is often also a sloppy.
Horse assist swashes are a local product. Every time they go to the national difficulties, they will not be willing to jump out of the dance text ink, the standard action is two: one is to make the funeral into a happy event, and the other is to tout the leader.
For example: even if you are a ghost, but also happy.
For example: tearful lying to the victims.
Let's say: Thank you, Crown.
Then there is: the secretary and the county chief's eyes of the blood woven into the spring flowers.
Now, they are in a rush to the Zhong Nanshan academician portrait, painted like a bell, the whole place "too on the old gentleman anxious as the law order" as.
I suspect that one day they will write such words:
More understanding, less cowhide!
Not to advertise, don't report, don't encourage.
But you have to figure out what's most needed ahead.
What the line needs is not cheap sympathy, empty slogans, not boring touts, but
Understand
Yesterday, I saw the news of the interview with the social worker of Wuhan Bai-Step Pavilion, and the conclusion was:
They're bitter, they're hard.
The general public is very bitter, it is very difficult.
Grass-roots cadres are more bitter and difficult.
Members of the public are in trouble and can find them.
They're in trouble.
That's right, it's about holding the "Million Family Banquet" hundred-step pavilion.
The banquet was not what they were going to do, but something happened to them.
Gritted your teeth and took the insult sand.
The citizens said thank you and moved them.
So I hope that all the media can
More understanding, less cowhide.
Hold the bottom line and don't sing high-pitched.
Your lens, don't always look at the leaders, and we don't want to see anything like that:
Take a photo in the affected area with a red flag.
Stand in front of the hospital bed and sing.
Followed the leader with a full smile.
That's just a bad association.
Please pay attention to the bottom layer, please pay attention to the first line, please pay attention to the outbreak!
Including those who don't even count the numbers!
Please learn to speak, please learn to understand the people!
This, is it hard?

28. "Gofu: I am confident that "SARS-like incidents" will not occur again"
Original Sub-Rice Wenzi Rice
How did this sudden new corona outbreak come about?
It may take many years to find out the truth, or it may never be found.
However, as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the National Health and Reform Commission expert member, the director of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu academician, his role is to ensure that the country to avoid the recurrence of the SARS epidemic 17 years ago.
On March 4, 2019, at the second meeting of the 13th CPPCC National Committee, Gao Fu, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), said in an exclusive interview with Jinyang.com:
At present, China's infectious disease prevention and control work is progressing smoothly, the national infectious disease surveillance network is running smoothly, China will not appear that year's "SARS-like incidents."
The tone was firm and uplifting.
However, nine months later, the outbreak of the new crown outbreak, the number of infections, the number of deaths far exceeded the 2003 SARS!
In terms of Internet buzzwords, this is a veritable face-knocking.
Perhaps the senior academician never thought that after SARS, the country will still face the severe challenge of plague one day.
In his statement, 1, the national infectious disease surveillance network running smoothly;
I didn't expect that his two promises would fail.
The outbreak may not be expected when, but why did the national infectious disease surveillance network fail this time and fail to alert the nation in a timely manner? Is there also the occurrence of "force majeure" events?
Would like to ask Mr. Gao, what is the function of the CDC?
Afraid of their own description of the wrong, I also dedicated Baidu, and to the CDC website to fully browse.
Look at the CDC's slogan on the web page.
You're not wrong, 30 words, and a word forgotten to disconnect with punctuation.
A website, that's the face of an institution. Serious propaganda like the mission slogan can be wrong, does that mean that many people don't care about their mission?
The function of the CDC is to play the role of the national team in disease prevention, emergency response, public health information capacity building, etc.
Unfortunately, when the new corona outbreak broke out, the CDC did not play its due role, but repeatedly sent the wrong message, wrong lying to the people.
Mr. Gao is a person, in a high position, but also an authoritative expert, why make a mistake, put the country in distress, put the people and water and fire?
From the public information, Mr. Gao's family is a learning from China and the West, famous at home and abroad.
According to enthusiastic statistics, at present, Mr. Gao has published more than 490 papers in SCI International Journal.
If you measure the age at which you were born in 1961, there have been an average of more than eight papers a year since the age of one. If from the age of 20, every year to publish more than 12 papers, that means every month to publish papers Oh!
To know that this is not ordinary papers, are published in international journals, from research to results, to the formation of papers, people do not eat or drink to do a year can not complete the work, senior academicians can be completed every month.
It's a miracle.
Some people say that Einstein's life-long published papers are not as much as our senior academicians a fraction!
This high yield, enough to make other academicians in the country "sweat".
In fact, this is not the most cattle. In the words of an industry leader, Mr. Gao is the most powerful person, the people are also the director of the CDC, is also the deputy director of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
People, as his name, are high above, and Flu is standing up.
However, it may be a shock to all to say that Mr. Gao's origins are anything to go by.
People are genuine veterinarians!
In 1979, at the age of 18, Afu entered the department of veterinary medicine in shanxi agriculture.
If you usually say to find a veterinarian to see you, you must think it is scolding you.
Veterinary doctor, isn't it the big one to slip around the world?
But now this veterinarian can prevent human diseases, giving 1.4 billion people the door to prevent and control diseases.
As for how he changed his mind and became the head of the National CDC, and listened to me in detail.
In 1983, Afu graduated from veterinary science and went to the China Agricultural University Medical College in Beijing for further study, studying microbiology and animal infectious diseases as a graduate student.
In 1986, he received a master's degree and stayed at the Agricultural University, where he worked as a teaching assistant and lecturer until 1991. At this time, he was bland, not even an associate professor mixed up.
In 1991, 30-year-old Afu arrived in the year of establishment, see the domestic development is limited, decided to go abroad to break in, then called "gold-plated."
He first studied for a Ph.D. in biochemistry at Oxford University in the United Kingdom and received his Ph.D. in 1994. He then studied or worked at the University of Calgary in Canada, the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, and Harvard Medical School, Harvard University in the United States.
It wasn't until 2001 that Afo, 40, finally got a job as a lecturer at Oxford University.
This decade is either on the way to school or on the way to finding a job. All the way dust servant, all the way forward.
It should be said that it is a microcosm of Chinese students who work very hard and can endure hardship.
However, in the academic, still did not see what kind of talent, should be able to read, will test the kind.
According to public information, Alford worked as a lecturer, laboratory director, and doctoral tutor at Oxford (until 2004), but without any proof of being an associate professor or professor.
Age 40, not bad, but for a masterofing technical personnel, still a lecturer, it can be seen that there is not much in the academic achievement.
Look, Qian Xuesen is 34 years old and an associate professor at the California Institute of Technology, and at 36 he is a professor at MIT.
Compared with money, people might say I'm bullying him. Then find a contemporary big curry.
He is also a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and in 1998, at the age of 31, Shi Began to be an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular Biology at Princeton University in the United States, and then became an associate professor and tenured professor at Princeton University for eight years.
In 2004, 43-year-old Afu through the Chinese Academy of Sciences hundreds of people plan to return home, from this life all the way to the beginning.
First entered the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as a researcher, doctoral tutor, in 2008 became the director of the Institute of Microbiology.
In 2010, he was a visiting professor at the University of Oxford.
In May 2011, he served as Deputy Director of the CDC (until July 2017).
In 2013, he was elected a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
In 2014, he was elected a Member of the Third World Academy of Sciences, and in the same year he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology.
Anyway, the official Lu Hengtong, the bigger and bigger, the identity is getting higher and higher.
One thing we should note is that Mr. Gao, along with Zhong Nanshan and the father of rice, Yuan Longping, although both are academicians, but this academician is not a fellow.
People afu is a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhong Nanshan and Yuan Longping are chinese engineering academicians.
As for the difference between the two chambers?
Some people say that it does not seem to be very different, just like the two sessions of the year, the NPC and the CPPCC, the same as representatives, can it be the same?
As for what later, the Third World Academy of Sciences academician stalked, is what errands, I do not know, I dare not ask.
Give you a list, just look at a lively bar.
Mr. Gao, it's really high.
Any one of his identities is enough to make those who think he is "high and high."
In 2017, Mr. Gao's career peaked and he became director of the CDC.
It is said that this is a vice-minister.
In any case, Mr. Gao is a winner in life, if there is no new crown outbreak.
When wuhan a new outbreak of pneumonia, Mr. Gao in addition to oral display of their own prevention and control capabilities, almost a hundred mistakes!
We may wish to take a fresh look at the gains and losses of this outbreak response from the time chain.
The earliest time the outbreak was discovered, we'll talk later.
At present, the outbreak of the earliest "whistle blower" is the South China seafood wholesale market near Wuhan Chinese and Western medicine combined hospital Director Zhang Jixian.
On December 26, she was the first to find unexplained SARS pneumonia patients, and quickly reported to the Jianghan District CDC, the next day also reported to Wuhan City and the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Therefore, on December 31, 2019, the first batch of eight national expert groups headed by Mr. Gao went to Wuhan to conduct field visits, collect samples and collect data.
It was concluded at the time that the new coronavirus was "preventable and controllable" and "does not pass on to people".
Look at everything in your hands.
The day before, december 30, young party members, Dr. Li, an ophthalmologist at the city center hospital, and seven other doctors, all of whom found heresy in the patient's case, were alert to the well-intentioned warning in the WeChat community to be well-intentioned.
The december 31 briefing was in fact a direct confirmation of the folk "rumours" circulated by the eight doctors on private lying.
Only no one thought, is this good deed, 8 doctors with a conscience by the police in the name of "rumours" "admonishment."
Why admonish? Who ordered the police to come forward?
It is not known yet.
What is even more unexpected is that after Mr. Gao vowed that the new coronavirus "will not be transmitted to people", Dr. Li was infected during a visit to treat patients.
The day is January 8th.
Meanwhile, at another hospital in Wuhan, a patient infected 14 health care workers.
Another member of the expert group, Dr. Wang Guangfa, returned to Beijing and found himself infected and had to be admitted to hospital.
As a member of the national expert group, while saying, "preventable and treatable" "no human beings", while they were infected again, it is simply high-level black.
Of course, Mr. Gao's Thunderian language continues.
When 84-year-old Zhong Nanshan academician overnight to Wuhan to find the facts of the outbreak, January 20, we saw him seriously told the Chinese people, Wuhan epidemic "can be sure that there is a phenomenon of human transmission."
Note that there is no vague term, perhaps, and perhaps, zhong Nanshan academician is using "yes".
A time of world shock, to know that the first two days of Wuhan is still bustling, bustling city, million.
Now that the outbreak has been disclosed, the Chinese people are very concerned, those people are susceptible to the population? How to prevent and control it?
January 22, that is, before the closure of Wuhan City, in the state-run on the day of the press conference Mr. Gao also said that the current evidence does show that children, young people are not susceptible to the virus.
In this hundreds of millions of people pay attention to the news, I do not know how many young people listen edited Mr. Gao's words, put down their hearts, the party, the party, the loitering.
Excuse me, 34-year-old Dr. Li and those 15 medical staff, is not a young man?
But Mr. Gao didn't say, we didn't know at the time.
If Dr. Lee did not give an interview later and did not disclose his experience of being admonished and infected, we would never know how the new crown outbreak was covered to death during that golden window of more than 20 days.
Dr. Lee died in the early hours of February 7, just a month after he was infected.
Even after the announcement of the new crown outbreak, Mr. Gao remained optimistic that "the Lantern Festival is expected to improve".
After this article, on February 15, Gao Fu, director of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was charged with serious disciplinary violations and was subject to the disciplinary review of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the supervision and investigation by the State Supervisory Commission.

/*********************************************************************************/

29. Now the Lantern Festival has passed, as is trapped at home, passive "ban foot" of us, the heart can only silently send greetings to his family....
In order to show his authority, Mr. Gao, but also to the media said, can pat the chest to ensure.
Come on, as a scientist, you are not a contractor, scientific rigor can be done by patting your chest?
SARS has been 17 years, has the vaccine been successfully developed?
Do you have any special medicine?
Of course, you didn't say time, maybe 100 years after the vaccine was developed?
Facts have proved that the world, not human sinains to overcome SARS, but SARS let go of humanity!
As long as the spring flowers bloom, the weather warms, the virus can not survive.
Finally, at the press conference, Mr. Gao played a trick, not answering the reporter's questions head-on. What to say to use the big probability thinking to prevent the outbreak of small probability events.
Just want to say, since there is this consciousness did it early.
Why do you, as the head of the first batch of national expert groups, have the responsibility of national epidemic prevention and control, but did not declare the outbreak in the first place?
Excuse me, Mr. Gao, what have you been busy with during this time?
Soon, it was revealed in the media that Mr. Gao was busy publishing his papers and had no time to take into account the ferocious outbreak of the virus in the country.
On January 29th, a paper in the prestigious medical journal New England Journal of Medicine, "The Early Spreading Dynamics of Pneumonia with New Coronary Virus Infections in Wuhan, China", caused a stir in China.
As mentioned earlier, Mr. Gao is keen to publish his paper. A lifetime of papers countless, can be described as sweat cattle.
In particular, papers are published in the New England Journal, the world's top academic journal. You know, scientists around the world have dreamed of publishing a paper in the New England Journal.
Most shocking lying to the nation, it was revealed in the paper that as early as mid-December 2019, the new coronavirus had spread human-to-human transmission between close contacts, the so-called "human-to-human". In addition, by January 11, 2020, there were 7 cases of infection among medical staff in Wuhan.
We see, from the time point of view, when the domestic is still saying "preventable control" "will not be passed on", Mr. Gao published in foreign journals in the paper but the writing of white and black letter is contagious.
The paper is quoted below as follows: "The rate of increase in the outbreak is estimated by analyzing data on cases between December 10 and January 4, as we expect the proportion of infections detected to increase soon after the wuhan outbreak is officially announced on December 13th".
This paper is the 22nd of January, the eve of Wuhan's closure.
It takes a lot of time to know a little bit about writing such a high-quality paper. Because the referenced data is subject to rigorous analysis and factual basis. This requires the collection of clinical data, laboratory data, and writing text compositions, which is a huge and cumbersome task.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the senior academician in January 22 before the submission, must have been in an earlier time, has completed the core content of the paper, and has obtained a scientific and effective argument, that is, the new coronavirus, is a high-epidemic infectious disease this argument.
If purely from an academic point of view, the author will surely become famous as soon as this article comes out.
But, the author, George Gao (Mr. Gao's English name), you also have a duty to prevent and control disease for the country.
As one domestic expert asked on Weibo:
From the paper's data, Mr. Gao had clear evidence of human transmission of the virus as early as the first few days of January, so in the three weeks from then until January 20, the news was covered up at what step?
Why mingming has long known that Wuhan's new pneumonia has a high contagious and current non-treatable, but in front of the camera, face does not change color, a proper lie?
Be aware that it's your job to issue an outbreak warning.
You run to Wuhan for the first time to investigate, the original is not for the country's disease prevention and control, just to facilitate their own publication of papers, with the country's resources for their own face gold ah.
How selfish and shameless it is!
Depending on the safety of people's lives, regard ingress with the safety of the country, give up their duties and give up their conscience. When a doctor reminds others in good faith, also shout, don't make a rumor!
Who is rumoring, and who is blinding the people?
This is not a scientific research, this is to see human life as grass mustard, is a naked crime against the people!
Mr. Gao's behavior can't even look down on the Ministry of Science and Technology.
On January 29, the Ministry of Science and Technology's website said that until the epidemic prevention and control mission is completed, scientific research units should not focus on the publication of the paper.
One can see that the front pointed directly to Mr. Gao.
In fact, if on December 31st, according to the objective reality of the outbreak, and the case information submitted earlier by Dr. Zhang Jixian, the national and local prevention and control work should be immediately recommended.
Because, the next day is New Year's Day, the country has not yet begun the Spring Festival, this is the outbreak before the best prevention and control of the "golden window period."
Yes, history has no assumptions.
When we see a person in Fujian for hiding the truth about their wuhan return, and eventually caused more than 4,000 people in the area to be quarantined news, we will be angry.
One man concealed the destruction of a city.
In fact, a person's concealment can also destroy a country.
The country is now semi-paralysed because of its own self-interest, and 1.4 billion people across the country have been victims of the outbreak.
The country's economy will suffer a heavy loss, last year China's GDP was 100 trillion, this year even a percentage point decline is the loss of 1 trillion ah.
This means that many companies will go bankrupt, many will face unemployment before they go to work, and many of the bottom-line workers who have stopped their hands will have a harder time.
For example, the well-known Xibei catering, that is the sale of noodlefish, the person in charge of public shouting, the company more than 20,000 employees to work, even if the loan pay, but also not for 3 months.
Now the national poverty alleviation has entered the stage of attack, in fact, compared with the remote rural areas, there are a large number of urban poor. A single illness can lead many families to abject poverty. Moreover, too long a "ban foot", may also cause some people's psychological problems, causing social worries.
Look at those who died in the outbreak.
Today's death toll from the outbreak has reached 1,114, and behind the icy numbers, it was once a living life.
Some say a person died and destroyed three families. 1,114 people died, meaning 3,342 families were devastated.
Long too much to hide, mourning people's livelihood as much as difficult.
Why is this happening?
Today is February 12th, just 20 days after the announcement of the new corona outbreak on January 20th, leaving many people in a desperate situation.
Writer Fang Fang once said in an interview:
"A grain of gray in the times, falling on the individual, may be a mountain. And we are in a dusty time. "
More than 60,000 confirmed, suspected, serious, dead cases are being turned into numbers beating online, how many of them can resist the mountain? How many people will be crushed by the mountains to death?
Dr. Li, the young "whistle-blower", even though lying in the intensive care unit, still hoped to return to the front line of the fight against the epidemic, but he was unable to resist the mountain that had been pressed on his head.
"Out of the teacher did not die first, long make the hero tearful", should be the world's biggest regret.
What lessons have we learned from SARS 17 years ago?
We have reflected, but the most terrible is not the tragedy, the most terrible is the tragedy after we forget the tragedy! So the tragedy resumes the tragedy, the tragedy how much!
At this point, Mr. Gao may be preparing a tasteful lunch. And Wuhan many forced to "ban foot" at home, perhaps some people have eaten up vegetables, every day is in salt water mixed rice, also dare not go out.
Wuhan in this outbreak prevention and control of mistakes and response is not timely, yesterday has been paid for this.
The outbreak is a real touchstone!
Usually everyone fight GDP, emergency when the ability to fight, in the face of the people's life safety, it is necessary to be able, mediocre under!
Otherwise it would be irresponsible to the people.
Everyone for this appointment to give a very high expectations, the Internet is shouting out: Hesheng, must win!
In fact, I believe that many people, like me, are not surprised at all, on the contrary, I think it is too late.
It is clear to everyone that in this sudden outbreak of the new crown, the whole of the province to Han some in the high position have played a very incompetent role.
They have lost their responsibilities, repeatedly released misinformation, and trapped people in danger.
In the face of disaster, any irresponsibility will be severely criticized by people.
Now, we believe that the whole country is working together on the right path to fighting the new corona outbreak.
Think of the poems of the Yankees:
Some people are alive, he is dead;
Some people are dead, he's still alive.
Some people ride on the people's heads: "Oh, how great I am!" "
Some leaned down to make cattle and horses for the people.
Riding on the people's heads, the people broke him down;
To the people as cattle and horses, the people will always remember him!
Yes, some people live as light as Hong Mao, some people die heavier than Mount Tai!
Dr. Lee, who was "admonished", left on February 7. At the age of 34, he left behind a family of young men and an unborn child. He was a man who had truly spoken for the life and was hailed as a hero after his death.
An ordinary and great hero.
Meanness is the passport of the meanman, and noble is the epitaph of the noble.
The former people have taken the yellow crane to go, this place empty yellow crane tower.
The yellow crane is gone forever, and the white clouds are a thousand years old.
The dead are dead, and the living will live to death and to live bravely.
Just want to ask, Mr. Gao, how are you?
In what way do you intend to thank or thank the people of the country?
We're all waiting!
Long-term adherence to original is not easy, such as the article resonates with you, don't forget praise and forward, to support me to continue to analyze the creation, thank you!

30. On Paper Disease Control: Director Gao Fu compared himself to Fan Bingbing, but it reminded me of Zhao Shu
Original Deer Sonning
The old saying goes, people are more dead than human sons.
On December 30, 2019, Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, issued a warning in the WeChat group, allowing some people to prepare early. So, Mr. Gao Fu, director of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on the same day, what are they doing?
I looked for half a day, finally found: this day, GaoFu academician in the Chinese Academy of Sciences Microbiology Fanglan lecture hall to give a report. The report, entitled "Innovation and Entrepreneurship - Demand-oriented Microbial Science Research", emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurship, application transformation, and especially brokering. He said (according to the Science Network of China):
"
China's "card neck" "card brain" problem, now some have solved the scientific problem, but after the solution, these scientific achievements have not been translated out. We apply conversion research badly because there is a problem with the conversion mechanism. In a sense, this is because we don't have "brokers" (intermediaries, brokers) and we don't have a mechanism. Stars can have such a high appearance fee, is they talk ingress one by one?
Now, I am in the application office (CasU Microbiology Institute) for our key laboratory (GaoFu as the institute's pathogenic microbiology and immunology key laboratory director) to hire a results promotion assistant, I am looking for this person is "Broker".
I'm Fan Bingbing, and I hope Broker can sell our results at a good price.
I found the lecture poster at the time.
There is nothing wrong with this passage alone. Of course we should encourage scientists to make a lot of money and get rich. But don't forget: Mr. Gao Fu, the academic bull who has published four or five hundred SCI papers, is first and foremost the director of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This position has a great mission for the country. At a moment when a general practitioner was pressing to sound the alarm, the director of the CDC was busy recruiting agents, hoping to "sell a good price". (A year ago, Fan Bingbing was punished for tax evasion, paid 800 million) This time from Fan Bingbing, is it appropriate? Honey confidence!
Now we know that on December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian of the Chinese and Western Medical Hospital in Hubei Province discovered the infectious disease from the seafood market in South China and reported it to the local CDC the next day. Also on December 26, according to the "medical community" contained in the "new coronavirus is found in this way", a company on the detection and interpretation of the virus and SARS similarity of about 81%, think that with the plague a level, information analysis confirmed that SARS virus, but not sure whether it is a new subtype. A nearly complete genome sequence was assembled on December 27, the next day.
Conversation sat on the morning (left) and afternoon (right) on December 26th, by the hill dog
The company found the problem is significant, directly to Wuhan CDC, face-to-face report. On December 30th another company detected that the virus was highly similar to SARS. The discoverer said: "At this time the mood is both very tense, but also very excited." The tension is that this unknown virus can be as scary as SARS; the excitement is that we have detected and identified the pathogen early through mNGS technology, isolated the patient, and may be able to smother it in the cradle by prevention and control before it spreads widely! But then, he wondered: "The biggest feeling is disappointment, pain, and anger." We've all found out it's so timely, why is it still not under control? Let the whole country into the outbreak? "From December 26th to January 20th, who made us miss the opportunity?" On the morning of December 31, Hubei Voice reporter went to Wuhan South China Seafood Market survey, in the afternoon, the first financial reporter went to the seafood market survey, were surprised to find that the market is still operating normally, merchants simply did not hear that someone infected with unexplained pneumonia. At that time, the number of confirmed cases of infection had been 27. So, Director Gaofu, what are you doing? After the SARS outbreak in 2003, the state spent heavily to establish the "China Infectious Diseases and Public Health Emergencies Monitoring Information System" (network direct reporting system), sinking into the township health hospital computer, unexplained pneumonia is the focus of monitoring and reporting. The CDC has a team of people specially monitored, once the discovery of unknown pneumonia in one place more than 5 cases, automatically trigger the verification mechanism. This network direct reporting system is not a step-by-step report, but, all parts of the country, as long as the hospital in the network system click to report cases, the Cdc should receive the first time. Therefore, If Gaofu director said not to know, either the national money spent, the disease control system failed, did not look at in a timely manner, this is dereliction of duty; In both cases, the probability is very small.
However, as a member of the CPPCC National Committee, Gao Fu, is also particularly confident. "I can say with confidence that the SARS incident will not happen, thanks to the well-built infectious disease surveillance network in our country, and the virus has come and we can block it," he said solemnly during the 2019 session. (See Beijing News, Beijing Youth Daily, etc.)
I believe you big devil! At a young age, Mr. Gao holds six academic titles (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Third World Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Microbiology, European Molecular Biology, Foreign Fellow, African Academy of Sciences), and as of 2017, more than 10 signed works have published more than 450 SCI papers. Therefore, Gaofu academician from Fan Bingbing, is indeed a capital, but it reminds me of Zhao Shu. "Historic Lian quite like a column" contains: "Zhao shou from a young time to learn military law, words and military affairs, to the world can not be when." Taste and its father's extravagant military affairs, luxury can not be difficult, but not good. The mother asked the luxury, luxury: 'Soldiers, dead also, and easily said. So that Zhao will not be included, if there is, break Zhao Jun will also. This paragraph means: Zhao Shu since childhood to learn military law, talk about strategy, self-confessed that no one in the world can match him. Once with his father Zhao luxury talk about the use of soldiers, Zhao luxury also difficult to fall him, but also do not think that he is good military law. Zhao's mother asked why, Zhao said: "war, the relationship between life and death, the children should say so easily and easily." In the future Zhao Guo does not have to include children for the will also be just, if really use him, so that Zhao Guo fiasco, it must be him. When Zhao Was appointed General and the army was about to leave, his mother asked Zhao Wang to withdraw. The reason was, "At the beginning, his father was a general, personally holding food and drink, dozens of people; Now, Zhao Shu did the general, the king's reward of gold, all take home to collect, but also visit every day to visit cheap and suitable field real estate, can buy to buy. Where do you think he looks like his father? "Unfortunately, Zhao Wang did not listen to it, Zhao Shou or in place of Lianpo, command Changping war. As a result, Zhao Guo 450,000 soldiers were killed by the pit, the great loss of strength, leaving only an idiom: on paper. Today's Gaofu director, vowing, "SARS incident will not come back", light lying built a network can be blocked, just as Zhao Shu paper said that the world is invincible; Now, the national epidemic prevention, suffered unprecedented losses, will be the "long-flat war" of the year? Losing now the high director has not had the opportunity to go to the front line commander, otherwise it is difficult to say. On January 30th the New England Journal of Medicine published a paper signed by Mr. Goffin. The Ministry of Science and Technology quickly released a document: the epidemic prevention and control task is completed, should not focus on the publication of papers, should be written in the first line of the fight against the epidemic, the results of research applied to the fight against the epidemic. The Ministry of Science and Technology this time correction came very timely. Some people say that Gao Fu is only the director of China's CDC, there are health care committee, there are other departments, his power is very small ah, should not back the pot. I do not agree with this defence. What a person does is important; When Wuhan eight early warning person sashimi is treated as a "disinformation" the whole network strike, admonition, as china's disease control system, the first person in charge, Gao Fu director did not say a word, even let the South China seafood market normal business, do the report from Fan Bingbing, hope to sell a good price; Mr. Goffford said nothing, even turning a blind eye to the large number of health care workers who had been infected.
These two days, and see him pat his chest, said the vaccine is certainly no problem, my heart can not help but slowly emerge a " ? ":
Why do we support scientists being treated well, and why do we respect them? Because, a real scientist, tell the truth, the heart is loaded with ordinary people, speak ingress, thinking about the safety of ethnic groups, thinking about social progress. We respect them and want to give them preferential treatment, not because they put money first, put aside their responsibilities, and take knowledge as a hostage. If they do, what's the difference between the stars they attack and envy? How can Hede?!
In a public security crisis, those who hold the truth information have enormous power and have a great mission. At this time, if cowardice is not spoken, it is to indulge the spread of evil. If, a person who fails this test, he can also ask the society for sky-high compensation, it will be the decline of social morality.
This video is the second tearful interview by Mr. Zhong Nanshan to talk about Li Wenliang. Think about why this is not (or can't be) uttered from Director Gaofu's mouth:
The day before yesterday, I saw an article questioning Director Gao Fu being reported to have been infringed on the grounds that it "fabricates facts and arbitrarily stigmatizes scientists who have contributed to the country, seriously damaging the reputation of others".
I admit that Director Gao Fu is a "scientist who has contributed to the country" (added a word "over"), but I also believe that the facts described in this article are based on facts. As to whether it is "casual slurs", please judge the kings.

After this article, on February 15, Gao Fu, director of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was charged with serious disciplinary violations and was subject to the disciplinary review of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the supervision and investigation by the State Supervisory Commission.

31. "Viral prisons on the high seas", a person infected with this 3,711-person super cruise ship ...
Medical
Everyone wants it all to pass sooner...
Sudden! Japan's "Diamond Princess" cruise ship, the number of confirmed infections doubled overnight! Of the 3,711 people whose ships were blocked, 135 have been confirmed to be infected with the new coronavirus pneumonia! Eight of the pneumonia patients are of Canadian nationality!
The terrible reality is that doubling the number of confirmed cases means that the risk of infection for all passengers on board the ship is doubled. For example, five newly identified crew members, before being loaded into an ambulance, dined with a large group of colleagues in the canteen and prepared meals in the kitchen for passengers in each room.
Diamond Princess
This giant ship, which has been ravaged by the virus, has been drifting over the sea for more than 20 days so far, and thousands of passengers have been held for days in this increasingly terror-like "viral prison", and few people can be overwhelmed by the despair of deep bone marrow!
Canada's National Post published the story.
The latest news released today by Japan's Ministry of Health shows that only 336 of the ship's 3,711 people tested positive for the new coronavirus, while 135 of the 336 test results tested positive.
Health officials say resources are not allowed to test the entire ship for the new coronavirus.
CNN post: Japanese health officialsays won't test everyone for virus
Of the 336 people, 135 were infected. This is no doubt a terrible news for the more than 3,000 "uncertain" people left on board.
Of the 26 Japanese confirmed, 10 had just been evacuated from a Japanese charter flight from Wuhan, China. After leaving Wuhan, thought that "the rest of their lives after the robbery", and boarded this "terror cruise ship", torture wave after wave, such as in the "endless hell."
The cruise line issued a desperate statement: "It is no surprise that more people will be diagnosed. "
Medical workers are entering the Diamond Princess.
One passenger wrote on Twitter: "Things are getting worse and 60 more are sick. God, save the Diamond Princess! "
One passenger said that when he went to the first floor of the cruise ship for an inspection, a female passenger standing next to him suddenly began to cough violently.
"You can hear her coughing up her lungs. I have special sympathy for her, but I am also scared of a cold sweat, I do not want to stay in the same room as her. "
Tourists are out watching, but few wear masks
A Chinese mother trapped in a cabin room with her family, weeping in despair at the phone camera:
"I had no idea what was going on until I saw the news reports. The whole ship is breathing the same air, it's circulating air, we don't know how they filter the circulating air, we don't know where the people with symptoms are isolated, are they right next to me? "
Desperate passengers
A British passenger posted a selfie video on Facebook saying: "Many passengers have been affected by claustrophobia and depression is beginning to spread on board." "
Diamond Princess
One American passenger said he and his wife were almost driven crazy, "Imagine being imprisoned in the toilet every day, and that's the day we live." "
Tourists on cruise ships
A British couple who got married last month and boarded the luxury cruise ship thought they would have a honeymoon for life, but they didn't expect to fall into the trap that fate had set them. The husband has been diagnosed with the new coronavirus positive. He was taken to hospital in an ambulance. The new wife was alone, clinging to the wheel, waiting for news of her husband in solitude and despair.
After news of the surge in confirmed numbers on board, a Chinese female passenger collapsed, "I had to cry to get a little out of my anxiety and fear." She said on Twitter.
One passenger described it: "The whole ship is dead, except for the occasional sound next door, you feel like you're alone in a cruise ship." "
One passenger said they were treated like prisoners.
Every day, countless ambulances whizz edgled, picked up patients who had just come off the cruise ship, and then whizzed away.
One Canadian passenger said, "I feel like the walls on all sides are coming towards me." "
A Taiwanese passenger said he and his father lived in a windowless cabin room, the two had been coughing symptoms for many days, their father even coughed up bleeding, the two wanted to be tested for the new coronavirus, but the cruise ship said it would not be tested unless he had a fever.
Diamond Princess Exterior
A couple from Vancouver, Canada, are struggling with fear day and night. "As soon as I woke up, I started crying because I realized I was still on this ship and I needed to be locked up here for 10 days, so I probably cried every day next day. "I'm at a loss, I'm scared. The Vancouver couple revealed that the information provided to passengers by cruise ships was very limited and delayed regarding the outbreak on board. Often after national media reports, these ship's "parties" only through watching the news to learn that their cruise ship, confirmed cases have increased.
A group of Indians, posting a daily video on Facebook, beg sought the Indian government to save them from the ship. In the video, they say in Hindi, "The situation on board is out of control... The virus is spreading every day, very fast... It's threatening everyone's lives. ""Those of us who are not infected with the virus, why are we locked up here?! ""Save us who haven't been infected, and get off the boat before we get infected. "Soon, we'll all be infected. No one knows who will be next. "
A Japanese woman looks anxiously on the shore of Yokohama port where the cruise ship is docked. She said her 84-year-old mother was on board and had a fever but could not get the attention of the ship's medical staff. "She's feeling very bad right now. I hope she can get off the ship quickly. Or, even if she can get a little bit on the ship's room. But now no one on the boat noticed her. "
According to media reports, everything on the "Diamond Princess" has become a horror film:
A deadly virus has spread to new passengers on a 17-story luxury cruise ship full of thousands of tourists.
On the days of the blockade, locked up in a closed cabin room, many people nervously recall all the trips they made after boarding the cruise ship, including where to eat at the restaurant, watching an opera at the cinema on the sunday, when to party by the pool with their children... No one knows if they have come into contact with the wrong person at some point and become the new host chosen by the virus.
The American Cruise Line, which operates the Diamond Princess cruise ship, announced today that it will give a full refund to all passengers stranded on board due to the virus outbreak, including all previous cruise charges, onshore excursions, and all costs during the quarantine period.
The price of a 16-day cabin on a Diamond Princess cruise ship ranges from $3,600 to $5,800, while a suite costs between $13,000 and $17,000.
Passengers on board said the refund was good news, but he "wanted to get off the boat alive."
However, in the atmosphere of terror spread across the ship, there are some people "in danger", such as the following Chinese couple, isolated for a full six days, others in the anxiety and suffering, they are trying to stay active. A few square meters of small room, master playing tai chi to practice patience
The aunt sang the Chinese song "Tomorrow Will Be Better" to the window, giving the whole family a "boost"
Although the mother-of-two was a little scared as the number of confirmed cases on board increased, they believed they could hold on until the day they disembarked and came home.
A webcast platform today announced a free opening for all passengers stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who can interact with movie stars for free by simply signing up for an account on the site.
The site's president said the move was to help stranded passengers get rid of their fears and "make their minds think of new coronaviruses."
It all started with the diagnosis of a Hong Kong passenger. The Chinese man boarded the Diamond Princess in Yokohama, Japan, on January 20, and disembarked in Hong Kong five days later before being diagnosed with new coronal pneumonia in hospital. Upon receiving this news, the Diamond Princess immediately imposed a ship blockade.
The new coronavirus is currently spreading among people withnosis in China, which could become the "spark beefire" of overseas outbreaks, the World Health Organization's director-general said today. And yesterday, Dr Tan warned that the number of new crown pneumonia diagnoses outside China may be just the "tip of the iceberg" and that countries should be prepared for a bigger outbreak.
By the time of writing, the new coronavirus had infected 43,101 people worldwide and killed 1,018. The Diamond Princess has undoubtedly become the most dense lying center outside China.
Let us pray for those trapped in the ship, hope that all protect themselves, as soon as possible to survive this robbery!

32. How many disasters happened in the world in early 2020? 》
1. At the beginning of 2020, Chinese public opinion kept an eye on the new crown pneumonia outbreak in China. But looking around the world, there are many natural disasters and epidemics in different countries: pandemic, plague, mountain fire, locust disaster, drought, earthquake, snowstorm ... tens of thousands of people died. The operation team of the Chongyang Institute of Finance of the People's University of China (Chongyang, People's Congress) can sort out the disasters of various countries for readers, which may enable each reader to better observe the world and reflect on the present.
America
2.November 2019 to date Event: U.S. flu outbreak
Details: The deadliest flu virus in the US has spread in 40 years! The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in the winter of 2019, at least 22 million people in the United States will have the flu and 12,000 will die. Flu outbreaks have occurred in 48 of the 50 states. In addition to the flu, a virus called Noro is also attacking the United States. The Department of Health of Louisiana, USA, confirmed on February 6 that a casino in the southwest of the state had an outbreak of Norovirus, which is highly contagious and has caused at least 200 people to become ill. The virus has many routes of transmission without vaccines and specific drugs. It is reported that the epidemic has spread from the United States to Europe. In France, 26 people died of the flu from November 2019 to February this year, and the epidemic has spread throughout France.
After the outbreak of new crown pneumonia in China, the United States not only quickly implemented travel restrictions on China, but some American media and scholars also repeatedly made statements that cursed the Chinese and maliciously attacked China. In the opinion of NPC Chong Yangjun, this is too innocent. Fortunately, many Americans and people of insight have publicly refuted the malicious and racial discrimination of those people.
Mrs. Li Xianlong and Ms. He Jing reprinted articles on US media that discredited China and asked, "So what did the U.S. influenza B death cases expose?"
In fact, Chongyang Jun of the National People's Congress believes that, as far as the current situation is concerned, the outbreak of the flu in the United States has made China and the United States more fierce than in 2019 in terms of trade frictions. In 2020, it is more like a difficult brother. Any substantial benefit. Human beings are a community of destiny. Only by uniting to fight against various infectious diseases can we effectively reduce the damage to the human economy caused by viruses.
3. January 18, 2020 Event: Rare snowstorm in Canada
Details: On January 18, 2020, Canada experienced its biggest snowstorm in more than three decades! Snow conditions are particularly severe in St. John's and surrounding areas. According to reports, the thinnest places have a thickness of more than 40 cm, while the thickest places can reach 178 cm. Snow has brought a lot of inconvenience to people. Affected by bad weather, many local schools were forced to suspend classes and hundreds of flights were cancelled. Due to heavy snow on the roads, a large number of snowplow trucks have been deployed in the area. There are many scenes of heavy snow closing doors, snow-buried cars, and people digging trenches in the snow. This reminds Da Chongyang of a Hollywood disaster movie "The Day After Tomorrow".
ABC News Covers Canadian Snowstorm
Canadians open the door, add eyes, nose and mouth to the snow, and a snowman is done
However, what makes Chongyangjun admire is that Canadians have a spirit of pleasure in suffering. As shown above, although the snow is so thick that it covers the door, it has not stopped Canadians from creating. Human beings are small in the face of natural disasters. Only by being optimistic and enjoying the present can we find small pleasures and goodness.
4.January 29, 2020 Event: 7.7 magnitude earthquake in the Caribbean
Details: On January 29, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake hit the Caribbean Sea, a North American tourist resort, triggering a local tsunami warning. The building was shaking and the ground was full of pits. Netizens on vacation in Mexico, Florida and other places have a strong sense of shock. However, what impressed Chongyang Jun is also the humor of the locals. Someone humorously commented on Twitter: "Sitting crazy on my own pickup truck, I thought someone was dancing in the back compartment."
Caribbean earthquake
Early May 2020 Event: Another Dengue Fever Outbreak in Peru
Details: Since 2020, dengue fever has erupted in the rainforest areas of Peru, with 2,300 cases of infection and 12 deaths. The Peruvian government has taken urgent action to curb the spread of the dengue fever. The dengue fever epidemic is mainly concentrated in tropical rain forest areas. The elderly, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases are susceptible to high-risk groups. Some patients have died due to delayed treatment.
Peru's "Business News" official website report
According to the Peruvian media Peru21, the outbreak of the dengue fever was partly due to the lack of awareness of the crisis among the people, the lack of cooperation with inspection and disinfection, and even the exclusion of health workers from entering their homes. Data show that a severe dengue fever outbreak occurred in Peru in 2017, affecting more than 68,000 people and 196 deaths.
Chongyang Jun of the National People's Congress believes that the recurrence of the dengue fever outbreak in Peru has also sounded a wake-up call for China, which is currently in the epidemic. It is only time to win the new crown pneumonia epidemic. But "anti-epidemic" is only an obstruction, not an annihilation. All kinds of viruses exist everywhere. What kind of experience has been learned through the epidemic situation, how to avoid the risk of such viruses in the later period, how to upgrade the national governance system, etc., all need to be reflected and remembered after the epidemic.
6.January 28, 2020 Event: Brazil reveals new mysterious virus
Details: In January 2020, scientists discovered a brand new mysterious virus in Brazil. 90% of the virus's genes have never been described in public scientific databases and literature before and cannot be identified. It is reported that the virus was found in Lake Pamplha, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and named after the water god in Brazilian mythology and folklore: Yarra virus. Even more worrying, the researchers described in their conclusions that the number of unknown proteins that make up the Yarra virus particle opens the door to another world, which reflects the huge variability in the viral world and the world is full of human knowledge Very few, or even no known, potential viral genomes are waiting for humans to explore and discover.
According to Chongyang Jun of the National People's Congress, human research on viruses is still fur. With the advancement of science and technology and the development of human fertile soil, more and more viruses will be discovered and recognized by us. We must not only keep fear when viruses invade And awe, it requires patience to explore for generations and generations.
Oceania
7.September 2019 to present Events: Australian fire, sandstorm, flood, hail
Details: For more than half a year, disasters in Australia have not come alone. Fires, sand storms, floods, hail have taken turns! Since September 2019, forest fires have been on the southern continent, where Australia has the most population. The fire intensified and gradually got out of control. On the evening of January 17, 2020, heavy downpours hit southeast Queensland, Australia. The "one-hundred-year" heavy rain triggered floods, causing severe local floods. Streets were flooded in some areas, and many shops were forced to close. Floods in parts of Brisbane and the well-known tourist city of the Gold Coast caused some roads to be closed; a huge sandstorm also struck Dubbo, a mid-western city of the country, on the evening of January 19, leaving many nearby cities Of its residents are completely in darkness.
The data shows that the Australian fire killed billions of animals in the fire, and the fire released a total of 400 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is about a year of emissions from the 116 countries with the lowest carbon dioxide emissions in the world. The sum of the quantities. The fire in Australia has made all the efforts of countries around the world to reduce emissions for several years in vain. It is understood that although the rain in Australia played a role, it still exacerbated environmental pollution due to the fire.
Global air quality and pollution trends
According to related reports, in the Australian wildfire, not all natural disasters and human disasters: 180 people were suspected of arson. There are both adults and minors, 24 of whom are suspected of arson and caused a forest fire, 53 are suspected of failing to comply with the fire ban, and 47 are suspected of discarding lit cigarettes or matches on the ground.
87% of fires in Australia were caused by humans
At present, it seems that the Australian government failed to handle the fire well and the people mourned. In the opinion of Chongyang Jun of the National People's Congress, the Australian fire and its secondary disaster should deserve more attention and truth exposure from the international community, as well as the help of various countries and the next step of supervision. Gather the power of the world to quickly resolve the Australian fire, otherwise the consequences of the fire will still spread.

8. February 2020 Event: Locust Disaster in Africa, Food Crisis
Details: The worst locust plague in 25 years is spreading in East Africa, with an estimated 360 billion locusts raging, posing an unprecedented threat to food security in some of the world's most vulnerable countries. In the worst-hit Kenya today, tens of thousands of people can eat food every day, and plague in parts of Kenya is also very serious, which is undoubtedly worse. Although these creatures are harmless, the situation is "extremely serious" and poses an "unprecedented threat" to the food security and livelihoods of the people of the Horn of Africa.
As global warming has intensified in recent years, the drought continues in southern Africa since 2019, which has reduced the Victoria Falls, which supplies Africa's food and water, into several trickles. The recent horrific locust outbreak in eastern Africa has undoubtedly caused greater damage to Africa. The locust plague has sharply worsened Africa's already bad food security situation. If the locust outbreak is not handled in time, the consequences of the locust outbreak will not only be devastating for Africa This may also put more people in Africa into extreme poverty and hunger.

When: February 12, 2020 Event: Ebola outbreak worsens in Congo
Details: The World Health Organization announced in Geneva on February 12 that the Ebola outbreak in the DRC still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. The Ebola outbreak was announced in August 2018 and has killed more than 2,300 people in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Ebola outbreak is not only known for its high mortality rate, but there have been as many as 386 attacks on Ebola-prevention workers and related infrastructure in Congo (DRC) since 2019, which has caused 7 deaths and 77 people. Injured, many communities affected by the epidemic are remote and difficult to enter, and the local security situation is not optimistic. The epidemic prevention and control should not be lax. At present, the local army has carried out military suppression.
On December 23, 2019, the General Administration of Customs issued an announcement to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus disease epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to China. The announcement is valid for 6 months.

Details: The Nigerian government has recently warned that an "odd disease" has erupted in the country, killing 15 people and infecting 104 people in less than a week. Four of them died within 48 hours of illness. Symptoms include headache, diarrhea, vomiting, heat in the body, stomachache, bloating, and weakness. According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization, in the past 50 years, about half of the world ’s plague incidents have occurred in Africa, especially in poorer countries, and plague events caused by viruses are prone to occur. Although plagues in Africa are not uncommon, they still deserve global attention.
In the view of Chongyang Jun of the National People's Congress, effective prevention of the virus through the recent events of new crown pneumonia, bird flu, and plague is a worldwide problem that should be taken seriously. International organizations should adopt more stringent surveillance measures to prevent the spread of the disease and strengthen virus defense and research.

33. "Saving Wuhan: The Three Toughest Weeks After the City Closing"
Financial Journal 02-17 19:49
   Chinese and foreign medical experts were shocked by the scale of the blockade in Wuhan, wondering whether the local government had overreacted. Because even during the most raging SARS period 17 years ago, Beijing did not take such a strong blockade measure. Instead, it chose to concentrate the patients in a temporary construction hospital in Xiaotangshan, a suburb of Beijing, for isolation and treatment. This reflects the unknown, major, and terrible nature of the disease-so much so that governments are willing to pay an unprecedented price.
Subsequent events have shown that the blockade of Wuhan has largely prevented the virus from spreading nationally and globally. But for Wuhan, after an unprecedented three weeks, it has become overwhelmed. The impact of quarantine on the operation of society is too great to be sustained for a long time, but the unknown and uncertain nature of the new crown virus makes people have to persist.
If we say that the shortage of daily necessities only reduces people's living standards, in the face of a rapidly spreading epidemic, the relative lack of medical resources in the entire city may be fatal. Almost all limited medical resources are focused on patients with new coronary pneumonia. Some people have inserted the indwelling needle of the injection tube and have to remove it temporarily.
In the three weeks since "City Closing", Liu Mei has experienced the death of her mother-in-law, her eldest brother, second brother, and her husband could not be hospitalized. Her father could not buy medicine for lung cancer. She told the Caijing reporter many times: " The whole family is not infected, but I can't stand it. "
Hubei Provincial Health and Medical Commission ’s caliber of epidemic statistics changed significantly before and after this: On February 11, 1638 newly confirmed cases in Hubei and 1104 newly confirmed cases in Wuhan; On February 12, 14,840 new cases were confirmed in Hubei. 13,463 new cases were confirmed in Wuhan. On February 13, 4823 new cases were confirmed in Hubei and 3,910 new cases were confirmed in Wuhan. "Bads are good." This is a mainstream comment on social media.
Even in the SARS period, there was no such shortage of medical supplies-the hospital lacked sufficient first-line supplies such as medical masks, protective clothing, and goggles, and doctors and nurses could only “hand-to-hand” with the virus, resulting in heavy casualties. This situation was particularly prominent before the beginning of February. At the same time, donated materials were piled up in the Wuhan International Expo Center, a temporary warehouse rented by the Wuhan Red Cross.

Empty streets, masked faces, closed residential quarters, blocked intercity traffic, invisible and seemingly ubiquitous dangers ... For Chinese people over 30 years old, late winter and spring 2020 At first, time seemed to go back 17 years ago.
During the winter and spring to mid-summer 2003, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, also known as atypical pneumonia) from Guangdong hit China from south to north, and Hong Kong, Guangdong, Beijing, Shanxi, and Taiwan were hit by the World Health Organization (WHO ) Listed as infected areas.
According to WHO statistics, a total of 5,327 people were infected with SARS in the Chinese mainland and 349 died; Hong Kong, China had 1775 people infected, 300 died; and Taiwan, China had 665 people infected and 180 dead.
SARS soon spread to 26 countries outside China. Singapore and Canada were also listed by the WHO as the epidemic area. A total of 8,422 people were infected and 919 died worldwide.
In January 2004, China launched an infectious disease and public health emergency surveillance information system (network direct reporting system), covering national health institutions, and pneumonia of unknown cause is one of the focus of its monitoring and reporting. According to regulations, when infectious cases are found in hospitals at all levels, they must be reported in this system as soon as possible, and the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing can simultaneously see the reported information.
On March 4, 2019, Gao Fu, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Development, said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from Jinyang.com: SARS-like viruses may appear at any time, but the national infectious disease surveillance network is well established , China will not have "SARS-like incidents" again.
Nine months later, however, a new type of coronavirus pneumonia (hereinafter referred to as "new coronary pneumonia") struck fiercely. At the beginning of December 2019, the first case of neonatal pneumonia occurred in Wuhan. More than a month later, the center of the epidemic area, Wuhan City, was forced to "close the city." Data from the National Health Council show that as of 24:00 on February 14, 2020, a total of 66,492 people were diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia in China, with 1,523 deaths. Among them, Hubei had a total of 54,406 diagnoses and 1,457 deaths.
As of February 14, a total of 37,914 people had been diagnosed and 1,123 died in Wuhan City.
The 1957 Nobel Laureate in Literature, Albert Camus's masterpiece "Plague," reads: "All that one can win in plague and the gambling of life is knowledge and memory."
The collective memory left by Wuhan in early 2020 will be the beginning of China's next decade.
An unprecedented "citadel"
At 2 am on January 23, the Wuhan City Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters issued an announcement. From 10 am on that day, the city ’s bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance passenger transport operations were suspended; the airport and railway station corridors from Han were temporarily closed. Recovery time will be announced separately. This "closed city" measure is understood by citizens as being able to enter and not to go out.
An unprecedented battle between humans and viruses began.
This is not an ordinary epidemic, nor is it a repeat of SARS in mainland China 17 years ago. It is the first time in human history to block a megacity with a population of 10 million. Immediately following is the redistribution of medical resources, the halt to urban life, and the temporary stagnation of economic development for several months.

Wuhan, at the center of the epidemic vortex, is an industrial and commercial center in central China. The Yangtze River passes through the city. Wuhan is also the largest land, water and air transportation hub in China and a shipping center in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Its high-speed rail network radiates more than half of China. It is the only city in central China with direct flights to the five continents.
Some foreign media refer to Wuhan as "Chicago in China" because there is also a declining steel industry and China's largest university town, where about one million people attend school. There are also many large auto factories in Wuhan that produce cars for global brands such as GM, Nissan, Honda, etc., which can also be regarded as "China's Detroit."
The outbreak of the new crown virus in Wuhan, which is a "nine provinces pass", coincided with the large-scale migration of the Spring Festival, which has become a nightmare shared by many epidemiologists and millions of people.
The local government explained: "(City Closure) effectively cuts off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curbs the spread of the epidemic, and ensures the safety and health of the people."
Chinese and foreign medical experts were shocked by the scale of the blockade in Wuhan, wondering whether the local government had overreacted. Because even during the most raging SARS period 17 years ago, Beijing did not take such a strong blockade measure. Instead, it chose to concentrate the patients in a temporary construction hospital in Xiaotangshan, a suburb of Beijing, for isolation and treatment.
This reflects the unknown, major, and terrible nature of the disease-so much so that governments are willing to pay an unprecedented price.

As of January 23, the day when the city was declared closed, 571 cases of new coronary pneumonia were confirmed in Wuhan, and the situation did not look so bad; but on February 14 just three weeks later, Wuhan had a total of 37,914 confirmed cases!
The message of "closing the city" in Wuhan seemed to be a wake-up call, so that Chinese people from all over the country who had little knowledge or disapproval of the epidemic have gradually put on masks and waited.
In the "closed city" of Wuhan, millions of people went in the direction they believed most in the face of the few choices.
Many people fled Wuhan overnight. Liu Lin, a citizen of Jingzhou, reached a maximum speed of 160 kilometers per hour on the highway, and did not rest for a moment. Soon, the out-of-city high-speed car was full, and it was difficult to move late.
At 8:30 am on January 23, only two ticket counters were opened at Hankou Railway Station. Some Wuhan citizens dragged their suitcases directly to the railway station ticket office to buy tickets out of the city. According to incomplete statistics from Caijing reporters, at least 251 trains were dispatched from 00:00 to 10:00 on January 23, from Harbin in the north to Shenzhen in the south, to Shanghai in the east, and to the west in the west. Nationwide.
At 10:00 am, the "City Closing" began, and the Armed Police Station stood in a line to surround the Hankou Railway Station. Passengers were not allowed to leave the station. One person who boarded the last train said he saw a lot of people crying when they didn't buy tickets.
Airlines also struggled to sleep through the night. They cancelled most of the flights involving Wuhan, but based on the "soft landing" principle and related flights, the last flight left Wuhan at 12:55 on January 24. The destination Guangzhou. Immediately, Wuhan Tianhe Airport, with an annual passenger throughput of nearly 30 million passengers, closed the departure channel.
At 2 pm, several expressways in Hubei Province began to be closed, and some "holes" were blocked one after another: the entrances of Gongjialing, Xiaojunshan, Hannan, Beihu, Huashan, Baiquan, Qinglong, and Xihu stations were closed; Beijing-Hong Kong-Macau Expressway Wuhan West, Wuhan North, Caidian, and Yongan toll gates are closed; other highway exits from Wuhan are also closed.
On May 26, Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan, informed that Wuhan has a permanent population of more than 11 million, a registered population of 9.9 million, and a floating population of nearly 5 million. As of the day, about 5 million people left, and more than 9 million remained in Wuhan.
Some fled and some returned to Wuhan retrograde.
Zhang Xu, a nurse at a designated hospital in Wuhan, had already returned to her hometown and was planning to spend the New Year with her family. On the day of "closing the city" on January 23, the 20-year-old girl rushed back to Wuhan overnight, and the driver took her to the service station in front of Wuhan Jincheng Expressway. She walked a long way in the dark and turned over with her luggage. A few roadblocks. After entering the city, Zhang Xu was waiting for a few hours by the roadside.
When Zhang Xu entered the city, she was stopped by relevant personnel. The staff asked her what she would do when she returned. "I'm a nurse and I have to go back." She replied.
Health care workers' sense of responsibility goes beyond fear of the unknown. For many ordinary Wuhan citizens, staying has never been a problem, because even if the epidemic is severe, Wuhan is still their home.
In the early morning of January 23, Wang Chen drove from Wuhan to Hengyang, Hunan for a business trip. On the road, he received a text message notification that Wuhan was about to "close the city." He immediately turned around and returned. Wang Chen runs a perlite plant located in Xinyang, Henan, 200 kilometers away from Wuhan, with annual revenue of more than 100 million yuan.
Wang Chen returned because he couldn't let go of his family. He also wanted to do something to fight the epidemic, and later he joined the team of Volkswagen Drivers of Shouqi in Wuhan to provide travel services for those in need, including transporting supplies and picking up medical staff.
After returning to Wuhan, Wang Chen found that most supermarkets had been sold out of vegetables and 84 disinfectant; cars waiting to be refueled lined up in a street; and fever clinics were overcrowded and a bed was hard to find.
"Finance" reporters called all designated hospitals in Wuhan on the day of "City Closing", including the first three hospitals: Hankou Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Seventh Hospital, and the second batch of 4 hospitals: Fourth Hospital The Western District, the Ninth Hospital, the Wuchang Hospital, and the Fifth Hospital, only the Red Cross Hospital have beds, and the other hundreds of designated hospitals are full.

The serious shortage of medical protection materials was a common problem in Wuhan hospitals at that time. When the third hospital became a designated hospital, it did not have enough protective supplies. When a reporter from Caijing called the hospital by telephone on the afternoon of January 23, the doctors had only a few masks, medical caps, and almost no protective clothing and goggles.
Affiliated hospital of Wuhan University of Science and Technology said that doctors can only use surgical masks and no gowns. Only N95 masks are available in the fever clinic and isolation area, and they are waiting for material support. A nurse at the People's Hospital of Hubei Province told Caijing that an ophthalmology clinic that had nothing to do with the epidemic has been opened up as a quarantine zone full of infected medical staff.
However, the hospital never expected that the difficulty of finding a bed and shortage of supplies lasted longer.
On the afternoon of January 23, light rain began in Wuhan. Citizen Zhou Xue went downstairs to buy medicine and found that the pharmacy was closed. But the chess and card room downstairs was still lively, and people pushed the cards boldly, and hardly anyone wore a mask.
At that time, Zhou Xue thought when to report the chess and card room downstairs, and when to work after the Spring Festival. But the next three weeks were very long for him-his father was hospitalized seriously because of the new coronavirus, and his grandmother failed to survive and died.
After Wuhan "closed the city", other cities in Hubei successively "closed the city." As of the evening of January 28, except for Shennongjia Forest District, all cities in Hubei have suspended trains, civil aviation and other external traffic and urban public transportation to varying degrees.

4. "Saving Wuhan ~ Three Difficult Weeks After Closing the City"
At first it was believed that this was only an interrupted Spring Festival. Until the "City Closing", the outbreak of illness and the stop of traffic reminded the public: whether it is a doctor, a patient, a driver, or an ordinary member of another city, the disaster is extremely fair to everyone and is closely related to everyone.
Subsequent events have shown that the blockade of Wuhan has largely prevented the virus from spreading nationally and globally. But for Wuhan, after an unprecedented three weeks, it has become overwhelmed. The impact of quarantine on the functioning of society is too great to be sustained for a long time, but the new crown virus is unknown and uncertain.
As of February 14th, it has been three weeks since Wuhan ’s “closed city”. The government has invested a lot of materials, personnel, and funds, but the medical system is still trying to catch up with the rising patients. Although the airport, high-speed rail, national highways and provincial highways have been blocked , Village road, but there are still people who can avoid the blockade to reunite with their families; despite people trying to recruit masks, protective clothing and goggles, there are still a large number of medical staff lacking basic protective equipment; although public opinion and experts are emphasizing the epidemic Highly contagious, there are still countless brave people who volunteer to go to the front line to support the epidemic.
Citizens struggling for help and watching
After the closure of the city, more than 9 million citizens remained in Wuhan. Data on February 14 showed that a total of 37,914 confirmed diagnoses and 1,123 deaths in Wuhan were equivalent to one confirmed patient for every 240 or so.
After "closing the city," Wuhan was almost empty. "Finance" sees that there are very few vehicles on the main roads of the entire city, and no cars or people can be seen in the most prosperous central attractions. Only 120 ambulances shuttle between homes and hospitals. In this large, empty city, people hoard food and medicine and isolate them at home.
Ms. Ran, who lives in a village in Liuzhi Street, Huangpi District, Wuhan, has not eaten fresh vegetables for two weeks. She eats bacon and bacon every day, which is "too greasy". In order to eat vegetables, she called the community, the streets and even the Development and Reform Commission, and finally asked the media for help.
The vegetable supply point is on the street. Ms. Ran said that many residents did not dare to take the emergency car because they heard that there were fever patients in the car. Express delivery also couldn't come in, not to mention the same city distribution. Ms. Ran hoped that the vegetable supply would sink, but the street replied: "There is no way".
Mr. Shen opened a beef soup shop a few kilometers near Zhongnan Hospital. He was from Xinyang, Henan. He had planned to return to his hometown on the 30th of the New Year, but he closed the city and had to stay with his family. A few days ago, he re-opened the take-away store because the take-out platform suddenly "don't pick up".
Each order can "make a few dollars", but it takes a lot of risk. Mr. Shen secured two doors, put the takeaway in a box outside the door, and wore a mask and disposable gloves throughout. The system also automatically crossed out orders from the hospital.
The lives of ordinary people are too embarrassed. After "closing the city," the guests were gone, and the original dozens of orders fell to only a few. The place for money is everywhere. The rent of a few hundred dollars a day, the loan owed, the cost of 200,000 yuan in the pre-opening period, the family's food and drink ... The tens of thousands of yuan rent he just paid was still borrowed from elsewhere.
Before that, he had been doing business in Jiangsu. After being introduced by a friend, he came to Wuhan a few months ago. Under economic pressure, Mr. Shen couldn't wait to be afraid. He just hoped to be able to go home as soon as possible, "I will never dare to enter Hubei (doing business) in the future."
If we say that the shortage of daily necessities only reduces people's living standards, in the face of a rapidly spreading epidemic, the relative lack of medical resources in the entire city may be fatal.
Liu Bai's mother-in-law is a cancer patient. She was going to Wuhan People's Hospital for treatment on the seventh day of the new year (January 31st), but now it is postponed indefinitely. Almost all limited medical resources are focused on patients with new coronary pneumonia. There are still many patients like her mother-in-law, and some of them have an injection tube indwelling needle, which must be temporarily removed.
Liu Bai said that her mother-in-law's hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism) medicine was also gone, and the doctor said there was no way but to find it by herself. She went to many pharmacies and was lucky to find two boxes.
She bought the first batch of masks on December 30, 2019. At that time, there were few cases, and officials have always said that they can be prevented and controlled. However, on January 20, 2020, Academician Zhong Nanshan came to Wuhan to investigate and publicly emphasized, "Being passed on," she understood the severity of the epidemic.
(On January 28, 2020, Zhong Nanshan described the new coronavirus as "definitely 'human-to-human'." Tu / Xinhua)
The community will send a temperature checklist every day, and a briefing will be issued in the afternoon. Liu Bai will go to ask why the fever patient is still isolated at home. Ms. Ran asked a reporter from Caijing, "Isn't it that 98.6% of the households were checked, why haven't we been checked yet?"
"The doctor made it clear that his father was a new type of coronavirus, but the diagnosis could not be confirmed because there was no test box." Sun Chen told the Caijing reporter at the end of January. Sun Chen's father had a cough and fever a few years ago, and his family did not take it too seriously. When the second day of the new year (January 25), "closed the city" a few days, his father coughed up blood. Sun Chen hurriedly sent his father to Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology for examination. Lung CT showed infection.
"I didn't expect this thing would fall on my own house." Sun Chen said that her parents had never been to the seafood market in Wuhan, but only bought vegetables at a vegetable market near the neighborhood. The family didn't wear masks until the day of "closing the city."
Sun Chen's father is 70 years old and his mother is 66 years old. Both have hypertension, diabetes and other basic diseases and can only be isolated at home. "I must send my father to the hospital bed." Sun Chen said.
What does a bed mean? Because there was no bed, Li Kaimeng, who lived in Hanyang, watched his father breathe hard at home for a night, and eventually suffocated. His father was a military cadre who was a pillar of the family during his lifetime. After the unfortunate death of his father, the car at the funeral home arrived more than ten hours later. They were also very busy and had to pull several times in one trip.
The grandmother of the railway employee Chen Li, who lives in Wuhan, also sat in the outpatient hall of Hankou Hospital for three days because she had no hospital bed, but she did not hold back, and the rescue died.
These patients were not diagnosed before they died, so they were not counted as "diagnosed deaths".
As of early February, a reporter from Caijing had interviewed more than a dozen patient families in Wuhan. Most of the families were infected with each other, helping each other's critical elderly and pregnant women to move to various hospitals, seeking beds for family members in the frontline.
According to the reporter of Caijing, there are generally only two ways to be admitted to hospital. The first is to queue up in the community. Patients first go to the community to submit lung CT and blood routine reports, the community reports the street, and then according to the priority of the new bed in the hospital, patients need to be admitted to the hospital with a hospitalization ticket; The hospital waited in line for 48 hours to get the results. After the diagnosis was made, they could not be rejected by the hospital.
But before Wuhan urgently took measures to centralize treatment and release the diagnostic standards, these two paths were not easy. Each of them may be endless waiting, and it may be the torment of life and death.
On February 1st, a doctor from Wuhan Fifth Hospital told a reporter from Caijing that the designated hospital had a large number of cases waiting in line with hospitalization sheets, but could not enter because of tight beds.
Then there is the problem of false negatives in the kit. Another designated hospital doctor told Caijing that the positive rate of nucleic acid test in their hospital was only 45%, and patients had to do several tests to confirm the diagnosis.
Under the epidemic, the admission of special populations has also become a problem. A family member of a pregnant woman living near a paper kindergarten in Jiangxia District, Wuhan City told a reporter from Caijing that the pregnant woman at home had been pregnant for 8 months. The latest diagnosis showed a severe infection of both lungs.
However, pregnant women will not be admitted to designated hot spots, and fetal heart rate monitoring will not be available in outpatient clinics. Women and children in the district and women and children in the province will not send and receive fever patients. A few days after the family tweeted for help, they got the attention of the community and the district government on January 31, and they ran to and from several hospitals in the community vehicle. Finally, they were admitted to the East Hospital of Wuhan University People's Hospital on the morning of February 1 .
Wang Ming's father had previously been undergoing regular dialysis at Huarui Wuhan Iron and Steel Hospital. However, since his father was diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, this hospital rejected Wang Ming's treatment needs. "Patients with new coronary pneumonia can only go to designated hospitals for treatment." However, in designated hospitals such as Wuhan Third Hospital and Wuchang Hospital, Wang Ming's answers were "dialysis rooms have been closed."
"We haven't found a place to do dialysis." Wang Ming told the Caijing reporter on February 4 that the next day (February 5) was the deadline. The countdown of renal dialysis is more cruel than neocoronary pneumonia. Without timely dialysis, a large amount of leeches (swelling caused by water in the interstitial space of the patient) will remain in the body, which will be life-threatening. Within 72 hours, Wang Ming ran to more than 20 hospitals, and he almost closed his eyes.
All these dilemmas ushered in a turn for the better in early February.
On February 5th, the Hubei Provincial Health and Health Commission issued the "Announcement on the Designated Hospitals for the Treatment of New Coronary Virus Infection Pneumonia among Special Populations in the Province", which stipulated the designated hospitals for pregnant women, children and dialysis patients after suspected or confirmed new coronary pneumonia. Among them, patients with dialysis can choose Optical Valley Hospital of Wuhan Third Hospital, Gutian Hospital of Wuhan Pu'ai Hospital, Hankou Hospital, Wuchang Hospital.
At 11 am that day, coordinated by the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee, his father finally checked into the intensive care unit of Wuhan Ninth Hospital. At 4 pm, medical staff pushed a dialysis machine into the ward. "Dad can finally get better." Wang Ming said.
Under the epidemic, it is difficult to say which family is more fortunate. Sometimes getting used to despair is more deadly than despair. "Finance" reporters repeatedly interviewed patients' families, "The community does not care, the hospital does not accept, save us, we have no choice!"
From February 1st, the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission and other government departments took a series of emergency actions, from the opening of beds at Vulcan Mountain and Thunder God Mountain Hospital to the establishment of square cabin hospitals, which alleviated the bed problem. Previously blocked nucleic acid detection was gradually released. What's more important is the implementation of Decree No. 10 for centralized treatment of "four categories of personnel".
The "four types of personnel" are: confirmed patients, suspected patients, patients with fever who cannot be ruled out of new coronary pneumonia, and close contacts of confirmed patients. Among them, severely diagnosed patients and suspected patients must be admitted to the hospital for treatment, and those who cannot be admitted need to be recruited from other hospitals or hotels for centralized isolation and treatment. The regulations also added centralized isolation measures for fever patients and close contacts.
These new measures have been generally recognized and considered to be a powerful measure to cut off the source of infection and prevent cross infection.
At 5 pm on February 2, Luo Yi's heart finally landed. His elder brother, who had been seriously ill for many days and had nowhere to go to see a doctor, was notified by the community health station that he could stay in a centralized isolation point that night.
But at 8 o’clock that night, Luo Yi received a call from the driver of the community health station: "Your brother needs to leave the centralized and isolated hotel." He instantly hesitated. Next, the elder brother who had a high fever of over 39 degrees Celsius was sent home. The reason given by the community health station was that the high fever was severe, and the isolation point could not receive it without a doctor and testing equipment.
People who check in to the isolation point need to take their temperature first, and severe patients may be discouraged from entering. A nurse explained that because the hotel is only observing the isolation point, it is impossible to inject or take medicine. "There is no rescue measure for the time being. If the patient feels that the situation is dangerous, I really recommend not to live." Luo Yi felt regretful that the corresponding isolation measures had not been arranged for the isolation point.
The quarantine point is the expectation of citizens with suspected symptoms, where nucleic acid testing can be done and home infections can be avoided. However, the resettlement situation of the isolation point determines whether it can completely and safely accommodate patients with suspected diseases, and also determines whether the source of the epidemic can be controlled in a timely manner.
In the three weeks since "City Closing", Liu Mei has experienced the death of her mother-in-law, her eldest brother, second brother, and her husband could not be hospitalized. Her father could not buy medicine for lung cancer. She told the Caijing reporter many times: " The whole family is not infected, but I can't stand it. "
Wuhan citizens have experienced too much in these three weeks. Some people only had vague consciousness at the beginning of the epidemic. They never expected that they would experience the infection of their whole family or even the death of their loved ones. In their struggle against the long and severe epidemic, they struggled for help and watched for help.
Hospital in the epidemic vortex
All hospitals became the most crowded place in Wuhan. Li Lanjuan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said on February 3 that early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment are needed to combat the new crown pneumonia epidemic, but these are currently not available in Wuhan.
Due to incomplete understanding of the virus's transmission route and lack of protective materials, a large number of medical personnel were infected. Not only do they have to treat patients, they also have to protect themselves. Wuhan hospitals are out of order.
According to data from the National Health and Medical Commission, as of February 11, 1,716 medical staff nationwide had been infected with new coronal pneumonia, and 6 died unfortunately. "During SARS, not so many medical staff were infected." Peng Zhiyong, director of the Department of Critical Care Medicine at the Central South Hospital of Wuhan University, told reporters in Caijing.
From January 6th to 17th, the "two sessions" of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were held separately. During the period, except for the 41 confirmed diagnoses reported by the Wuhan Health and Health Commission on January 11, the Wuhan City Health and Health Commission always reported no new cases of new coronary pneumonia during the two "two sessions" and stated that "there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission".
At this time, health care workers have become infected. A colleague of Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, told the Caijing reporter that Li Wenliang first reminded everyone to pay attention to protection in WeChat group on December 30, 2019. They quickly bought a box of N95 masks at their own expense, but You can't buy it in a day, "the hospital has limited preparations for protective supplies, and cannot keep up with the daily consumption of fever patients.
Around January 12, Li Wenliang was admitted to the ward as one of the first infected medical staff at the central hospital. As an ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang was infected at the beginning of January. Before he returned to his post, he was also "admonished" by Wuhan police for warning of the outbreak without authorization.
Around January 10, Zhongnan Hospital admitted a patient with abdominal discomfort. Peng Zhiyong said that the first cause of medical infection is the abdominal disease patient, he infected more than a dozen medical staff, one of the doctors also infected the virus to the family.
A 120-car nurse said she had operated on a patient with a brain haemorrhage in an anaesthetic department, and only admitted to having a fever for a week after surgery, and that six medical staff were unprotected during the operation.
On the evening of January 20th, Zhong Nanshan, head of the national health and health committee's high-level expert group, said that "there must be some human transmission", which redefines the severity of the outbreak. In response to fever patients "due to disorderly medical treatment brought about by cross-infection and disease transmission problems", On January 22, Wuhan City identified the "7 plus 7" model, that is, near seven large hospitals in urban areas, the selection of 7 secondary public hospitals as fever outpatient fixed-point hospitals, specializing in the treatment of fever patients.
It was on this day that Dr. Li Peng joined a fever clinic at one of the designated hospitals. He told Caijing that by the time he was notified, the hospital list had been made public and that "there was little preparation time in the middle". On the same day, a large number of patients poured in, the hospital to transfer existing patients, but also to do the ward transformation work, busy.
On this day, patients queue for more than six hours abound. Many patients are in a bad mood, some people cry, some people quarrel, some people scold.
At this time the status quo of the whole of Wuhan is that the initial infected patients have passed the incubation period, the new corona pneumonia large-scale outbreak, they panic into various hospitals, but Wuhan's medical resources have been extremely tight. Inadequate isolation conditions, lack of kits and beds, poor access to volunteer aid, large numbers of patients are not hospitalized, and hospitals and doctors are in unprecedented difficulties.
Wuhan Central Hospital doctor Tian Wei recalled to Caijing reporter, when fever, suspected patients and medical staff are outside the quarantine area at will, patients sitting in the aisle, the pollution area is getting bigger and bigger.
Zheng Junhua, vice president of Shanghai First People's Hospital, recalled to Caijing that on January 27th he led the first batch of Shanghai medical teams to their destination.

/*********************************************************************************/

35. Channel. "In my 13 years as dean, I have never used such a high level of sensor control protection. Zheng Junhua said.
Li Peng said that he did not know the diagnosis process until January 29, first to department screening, report to the hospital, the hospital and then reported to the district. Only 3-5 patients per day in each department have the opportunity to be tested.
The number of beds and testkits has not kept pace with the spread of the epidemic.
A female patient once told him that her husband had been infected and did not know if he would survive tonight. Li Peng looked at her lung CT, told her that 80% of the probability is new coronary pneumonia, has been very serious, and also opened her hospital. Li Peng told her that there were no beds at present and that she had to register for the queue.
"She was in a state of emotional breakdown. I don't know where the patient went later. Li Peng said.
"There are a lot of posts on the Internet mentioned that there are many patients in Wuhan highly suspected but unable to seek medical attention, but from the perspective of health care workers, we really try. "In fact, it is difficult for Li Peng and many medical staff to protect themselves because of the extreme strain of medical protection equipment.
(On January 27, 2020, a surgical anesthesiology nurse at a hospital in Wuhan fell asleep after the operation.) )
Li Peng's department has a total of 10 doctors, about 20 nurses, as of January 29, the department has a total of 7 suspected infected medical staff. If extended to the hospital- They all had fever and ct problems with their lungs. "Normally our entire hospital would be quarantined, but now it's a very time when there's a shortage of medical staff. "
On January 29th Li Peng was on his night shift. Before entering the ward, he saw that the mask was not in eligible, but he didn't have time to hesitate. The shift period is 4-hour shift, as masks and protective clothing must be changed every 4 hours. "If I go in a minute late, the co-workers inside add a point of risk. Li Peng said he could only wear it immediately.
Volunteer team "Yo! One member said January 27-30 was the peak period for medical supplies in Wuhan. The main problems encountered by the volunteers are high medical material standards, difficult channels to find, hospitals do not accept public funding, may be found to be at risk of being processed, logistics policy is changing every day, the shipping point burst warehouse but the Hubei terminal logistics can not keep up.
Caijing reporter obtained a Wuhan January 31 internal special report pointed out that the gap between the supply and demand of medical protection materials is large: Wuhan City, the daily average demand for N95 masks about 60,000, but the daily allocation of less than 30,000, more than half of the gap, medical protective clothing, the average daily demand of about 30,000 sets, the allocation of supply only a few thousand sets.
Late on February 6th, Dr. Li Wenliang died, and the mood of Wuhan medical staff reached its peak. A colleague of Dr. Li Wenliang said: "I wanted to open the system to check the medical records, and i saw that there were a lot of familiar names in the area and ICU, and the heartache was endless." "At this point she was working shifts, and the next day she had to get up early and go to the front.
Looking back, from January 23 "sealed the city" to the beginning of February about ten days, Wuhan medical and health system is the most chaotic stage. Since then, the government has gradually alleviated the problems of "difficult diagnosis", "tight beds" and family infections. With the community hospital diversion measures and the "four categories of personnel" centralized isolation treatment, coupled with medical assistance from other provinces, Wuhan hospitals have eased the tension.
As of February 12, Wuhan City has built 11 square cabin hospital, can open 6929 beds. Fire And Fire Mountain and Leishenshan Hospital also began to receive patients on February 4 and 8, respectively, with a total of 2300 beds-2600.
(On the evening of February 9, 2020, Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital received the second batch of new coronary pneumonia patients, with a total of more than 80 patients.) Pictured is a medical staff cheering the patient. Figure/China New)
Wang Fan, born in 1995, is a nurse at the fifth hospital in Hainan Province, and her companions went to a fangcabin hospital in Wuhan, where there are 1,600 confirmed patients with new coronary pneumonia, who spend six hours a day with patients to help them take their temperature, deliver food, and do a pharynx swabs test.
(On February 10, 2020, medical staff led patients to dance at the Living Room Square Hospital in Wuhan. Picture/Xinhua)
Fangcabin Hospital to treat patients with mild illness, the same day completed the day of treatment. Wang Fan said, around 10 pm, the group suddenly said to gather, Wang Fan just washed the hair has not yet blown dry down. On a night shift, the next day touch edgy hair is still wet.
They can't eat or drink while on duty at the square cabin hospital, otherwise protective clothing won't be used. The day shift runs from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Wang Fan prepared urine not wet, a colleague bought urine not wet size small, finally dripped out, by everyone joke.
(On February 12, 2020, medical staff at the Fangchi Hospital of Tasi Lake on the banks of the River Bank of Wuhan were ready to go into the cabin. Figure/China New)
Ensuring safety comes first. Especially when taking off the protective suit, Wang Fan and his colleagues can not move too much, to "slowly roll down", can not touch the outside of the clothes, look after each other, "you are my eyes, I am your eyes."
On February 4, the National Health and Reform Commission issued the fifth edition of the new coronary pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program, which stipulates that Hubei region can be based on the typical signs of CT, clinical symptoms as a clinical diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia, even if no nucleic acid test paper testing has been done. The liberalization of standards of diagnosis and treatment, coupled with the complement of bed supply, has further eased the pressure on hospitals.
Subsequently, invisible patients were diagnosed, admitted, the number of stage diagnosis rose, only february 12, Hubei Province, new cases of coronary pneumonia 14840 cases, of which 13,436 cases in Wuhan. A total of 48,206 cases of new coronary pneumonia have been reported in Hubei Province.
In the emergency room, Shen Jun, director of emergency surgery at Zhongnan Hospital, and the common resistance of the patients continue. He had received a 45-year-old serious lying patient. The family of five, the parents all died of new coronary pneumonia, and his son was infected. The patient's condition is very serious, with high flow oxygen absorption and non-invasive mask ventilation, but the oxygen saturation of blood is still only 50%, finally had to give her anaesthetic intubation, on ECMO (artificial lung).
"Before the intubation, she watched us prepare, tears streaming down, and the fear was painful. Shen Jun said that there are many such cases, "our doctors have made up their minds to do everything they can to treat all the patients."
Separation, tension and grief, the emotions that pervade Wuhan, can only end at the same time as the outbreak. Out-of-control and panic are common, but not normal. Until then, what drove the city forward was a unique human sense of responsibility, love for the family and an instinct for hope.
The national system tested by the outbreak
For the epidemic prevention and control, cutting off the source of infection is an effective measure, but for the population of more than 10 million metropolises, the impact of "sealing the city" can be imagined. Not only is medical supplies in short supply, but hospital beds are in short supply as the epidemic spreads.
On January 27, Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone (Hannan District) Outbreak Prevention and Control Command in a document mentioned that the former Hannan District People's Hospital's infected area isolation ward beds repeatedly overstaffed, clinical department streated more than 150 patients, there is a risk of cross-infection in the hospital of the new coronavirus. At the same time, there are a large number of suspected new coronary pneumonia patients can not stay.
On January 30, Jianghan District reported to the Wuhan Municipal Government, "requesting coordination to solve the problem of patient admission." Although there are four fixed-point hospitals in Jianghan District, 142 confirmed patients were unable to be admitted to hospital as of that day.
On January 23rd and 25th, the Wuhan municipal government decided to build two hospitals, Mount Fushen and Leishen. On February 2nd and February 8th, two hospitals delivered a total of 2,300 to 2,600 beds.
From January 24th, when the relevant design plan of Fire Mountain Hospital was completed and delivered on February 2nd, Fushenshan Hospital has set a number of construction records. Fire Shenshan Hospital was originally scheduled to start receiving patients on February 3, but Caijing reporter at the scene that afternoon saw that some areas are still in the final stage of equipment assembly, air conditioning, ventilation and other equipment is still installed, some ventilators, beds and other medical equipment placed on the roadside has not yet been installed.

Towards 2400 hours on 3 February, as the ward was not ready, the ambulance transporting the patient returned 10 minutes from Mount Fire. On 4 February, at about 9 a.m., the first patients were admitted to hospital.

Beds are increasing, but more patients are needing admission.

36. Specific material reception and dispatch by a number of departments responsible: Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Statistics to coordinate the dispatch site work, Wuhan Municipal Logistics Bureau is responsible for the unified arrangement of the transfer of donated materials, Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission and Wuhan City Red Club is responsible for liaison to receive donated materials, access to the library information management, the development of material distribution list, coordination of materials out of the warehouse.
An internal document of Wuhan Municipal Committee pointed out that too many intermediate links are an important reason for material obstruction. From the application to the command, to the delivery of the hospital, need to go through the Red Association registration into the treasury, health and health committee initially proposed distribution plan, city command audit and record, quality supervision department to check materials, red will organize logistics transmission and other links, all the process needs nearly two days.
This is in sharp contrast to the efficiency of the donor. From January 25to to January 30, Shanghai Fosun Group purchased 14 tons of medical supplies from around the world, including more than 330,000 medical masks and more than 270,000 medical protective clothing. It took the company only four days and two hours to get the goods from the start of the procurement on New Year's Eve on January 24th to the arrival of supplies in Wuhan in the early hours of January 29th.
On February 1, Wuhan Epidemic Prevention and Control Command assigned Kyushu Tong Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., one of the largest private enterprises in Hubei Province (600998. SH, hereafter referred to as Kyushu Tong) to assist the Red Club to deal with the distribution of materials, 4 medical logistics professionals from Kyushu Tong, together with the Wuhan Red Cross, Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission and Wuhan Municipal Market Supervision Authority staff, command and dispatch warehouse staff, 24-hour rotation.
On the afternoon of February 2, Kyushu Tong officially took over the wuhan Red Cross material distribution work, involved in the National Expo materials site organization led by the head of huake alumni association.
Caijing reporter was informed that Kyushu Tong took over, the flow of access to the warehouse changed, after the material storage, Kyushu Tong inspection delivery orders, the goods in the warehouse classification, immediately provide a detailed list of inventory materials, Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission received the inventory list of Kyushu Tong Company, within 2 hours to give the distribution plan, Kyushu Tong after the planned sorting, Distribution by a full-time department.
A State Expo site staff told Caijing reporters that the process can be material access time from the past two days to a few hours.
Kyushu Tong took over after the lack of material distribution rights, the key change is wuhan City Health and Health Commission after receiving the list of materials, the preparation of the allocation of the time to two hours.
On February 4, the Wuhan Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection informed that he had been removed from his post as a member and deputy director of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Statistics in Xia Guohua, and given serious warnings and administrative records within the party;
On the same day, the Hubei Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection also publicly informed: because of the epidemic prevention and control period to receive and distribute donations in the work of inaction, violation of the "triple one" provisions, information disclosure errors and other negligence and responsibility, Hubei Provincial Red Council three office-level officials were held accountable. To remove zhang Qin Province Red Cross Party members, full-time vice-president, and give his party serious warning, government affairs record is too large punishment;
The resumption shows that, first, the Red Society is indeed unprofessional in handling the efficiency of the distribution of materials; The key to turning things around is, in addition to Kyushu Tong's professional ability, but also the government departments under pressure to greatly improve efficiency.
Wang Zhenyao, director of the China Institute of Public Interest at Beijing Normal University, closely monitored the donation and distribution of materials in the fight against the epidemic, having previously served as director of the Disaster Relief Department, Social Welfare and Philanthropy Promotion Department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Wenchuan earthquake, SARS period, he was involved in the dispatch of materials.
Wang Zhenyao analysis, and to solve the travel needs similar, to solve the demand for medical materials also went through three stages: initially, the non-governmental donation of materials to meet the emergency needs;
Regarding the donation and dispatch of social goods in this outbreak, Wang Zhenyao believes that the inventory system for medical supplies support can be built by means of technology such as big data. The needs of medical supplies are detailed and presented dynamically in the context of the number of patients, with a particular need to indicate the number of items that need to be coordinated at the national level. Enterprises, public welfare groups and individuals in society, under the leadership of the government to form a joint force, open and transparent. In this way, the government ensures basic supplies, private charities and hospitals dock emergency donations, and hospitals have flexible funds to activate procurement.
Combined with this lesson, governments and charitable organizations can do more to fully activate civil power. For example, targeted donations should respect the wishes of the donor, but in the early intention of the donation contact can be coordinated, guide the donor to donate to the more scarce hospital, rather than the material after the material has arrived to coordinate.
Unlike SARS 17 years ago and the Wenchuan earthquake 12 years ago, China's communications, Internet, big data and artificial intelligence technologies are already quite advanced by 2020. But a number of interviews with Caijing reporters in the technology industry pointed out that the outbreak of early, in addition to the three major telecommunications operators to the relevant government departments daily to provide the national population movement of big data, more Chinese technology companies such as Ali, Tencent, JD.com, Didi, The United States, Shunfeng, and so on, its strength was not called in time.
After a short lag, new technologies began to be used.
In The neighboring province of Henan, the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, found Alibaba Cloud to build data in the first time after the outbreak in Wuhan, on the basis of which data was collected to set up a groping system and a registration system for people returning to Zheng.
The data desk generates a list of priorities that needs to be implemented at the grass-roots level, district, street, and community. If the old method is followed, in times of crisis, government personnel will usually use WeChat, USB stick and other means to transmit. Their disadvantages are obvious: first, using WeChat transmission, the user's data information is likely to be compromised;
Alibaba Cloud for this purpose developed a groping system, which is a lightweight development program, fast on-line, list import, grass-roots groping staff on the mobile phone can use the administrator account to enter, solve the problem.
A big data architect told Caijing reporter, to deal with large-scale disaster requires the government to set up emergency big data scheduling system, such as big data command platform, emergency logistics and transportation platform, emergency materialsupport support platform. To achieve the efficient summary of key data, accurate delivery of emergency supplies, urban emergency traffic dispatch smooth, so as to improve the effectiveness of the outbreak response command.
At the end of January 2020, Ma Zhaoyuan's team from Tsinghua University's Future Lab used artificial intelligence (AI) systems to build a national outbreak spread prediction model. Caijing reporter learned that the Shenzhen Nanshan government has used this model to plan the pace of the district's resumption of work.
It's not the end.
On the afternoon of February 15th, The wind and snow in Wuhan were added. Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, located in Donghu Road, Wuchang District, the fever clinic, against the wall of the row seats sitting on a few patients, heavily armed medical staff slightly idle, some of them only two days from other departments transferred to the fever clinic. Ten days ago, the chairs here were full of patients, and there were long lines of stand-ups.
(On the afternoon of February 15, 2020, the CT room of Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, was being tested for new coronary pneumonia.) Photography/Journalist Wang Xiao)
"Don't let go, the patient naturally less." A medical staff member told Caijing.
Medical school students Xu Yue's parents are infected with new coronary pneumonia, so that the mother has recovered and discharged from the hospital, the father also admitted to the hospital. Doctor Li Peng on February 15 made himself another CT, no problem. It has been a month since he received his first fever. Volunteer Wang Wei worried that the snow will affect traffic, February 16 morning will be donated to the hospital vegetables arrived, a total of 300,000 pounds, he is responsible for docking. "I've never seen so many dishes. Wang said. But he is more looking forward to the moment of Wuhan's unsealing, and the day when the outbreak really passed.
Despite the hope to return to work early, but the first bus contract driver Cai Shifu does not believe that February 20 will lift the "city seal", "the outbreak is still so heavy, how to get the end of February and early March." "First bus "sealed the city" after the provision of voluntary travel services, Cai Shifu has been working as a volunteer driver. Company according to the full-time rental business (equivalent to chartered cars) to the drivers to settle the fee, this business usually 400 yuan a day, the epidemic period of 800 yuan a day.
On January 29, the Hubei provincial government informed that all types of enterprises in the province should resume work no earlier than 24 hours on February 13;
On February 15th Wuhan, the provincial capital, showed no sign of returning to work. A civil servant who works in the Civil Defence Department strongly opposes the recent return to work. "I don't go to work, it's since the net. She told Caijing.
No matter sooner or later, the work will continue, "sealed city" will always end, as described at the end of the plague: when the city gate opened, people seem to be reborn, enjoy the joy of reunion. But after paying such a heavy price, we should not go back to the past.

According to the CDC, as of February 11, a total of 3,019 medical personnel were infected with the new coronavirus (including confirmed cases, suspected cases, clinically diagnosed cases and asymptomatic infections, of which 1,716 were confirmed), and there may be infections caused by non-occupational exposure.
The news quickly came to the fore.
Caused the sighs of countless netizens
In this unprecedented scale of the fight against the virus, thousands of "white soldiers" across the country risked their lives to help the building will pour, save the people and the danger.
Some of them gave their precious lives, some lost their health, some lost their hair.

February 9. unusual day.
41 aircraft, carrying 6,000 health care elite, from all directions of the motherland to Wuhan, QiQi landed at Wuhan Tianhe Airport.
Wuhan's most powerful back-up team is coming!
This time, the country's anti-epidemic plan is "one province, one city," the news said.
Is every province, leading a city in Hubei, fixed-point assistance (the following corresponding not allowed, focus on the feeling of ha).
I looked at this picture and was inexplicably moved.
Hubei like a sick child, is sad and helpless, a group of big brothercame came, say don't be afraid, we protect you!
This time, we sent out the Wang Fried combination:
China's most elite hospitals - North Concord, Nanxiangya, DongQilu, West China, four major groups gathered in Wuhan.
The vice-president of Beijing Concord Hospital led the team out:
To a white clothes, give up their own safety, keep a side of peace!
This is Concorde's commitment.
This is Xiangya Hospital, Central South University:
A hundred years of Xiangya, never negative country!
This is Xiangya's pride.
And Qilu Hospital. When they set off, Jinan police cars drove all the way to see them off:
When they arrived, a video went viral online.
The empty Wuhan airport, Qilu Hospital and sichuan Huaxi Hospital's medical team met.
The doctors shouted from afar:
"Which hospital are you in?" "
"Huaxi Hospital! "
"We're Zillu's!" Let's go together! "
A moving meeting.
The last time the two hospitals met was in 1937.
During the Anti-Japanese War, Qilu Medical College moved to Sichuan to run a school with Huaxi Medical College.
In 83 years, the war of resistance was long over. When a new war came, they met again.
When mountains and rivers meet, the country should be unharmed.
Others say "Wuhan refueling", are just said.
And these medical staff, is really to Wuhan refueling.
At the moment, the enemy, they are the warriors who carry the knife.
Only if these people rush up, Wuhan will be better.

In order not to worry her family, she lied about her work in the hospital.
When she came home to her husband, until she saw the photos sent by others, i knew she had gone to the front line.
The husband then called, and she quarrelled, blame her "how not to say a word" "even to see you a chance, you go."
Peng Yu mood complex, but also can not think much, then put into the intense work.
Even the axis turned a few days later, she saw, calm edgy husband, sent her such a WeChat:
"You are my wife and a comrade-in-arms. Mission is first, look forward to an early victory. "
See this sentence, suddenly tears.
Behind a few words, there is much deep affection hidden.
The story that had thought that "I have promised the country, and then difficult to xu Qing" will only be sealed in the history books.
But Don't want to, in 2020, a new version.
Come on, female Haojie, we and your lover together, hope you triumphantly!

A female doctor said of the scene when she set off, and fought back tears:
It was raining heavily outside, my mother's umbrella didn't take it, just followed us behind the car has been running ...
Said, she finally could not help wiping away tears: really good rain ...
I can imagine how worried my mother was.
She's bent on protecting people, she's going to protect others.
But when it gets there, who's going to protect her daughter?
And behind every doctor who marches, there is a group of people so worried about their parents, children, lovers?

Zhu Haixiu, nurse of Guangdong medical team, girl in 1997.
She was afraid of her parents to worry, and kept them from the line.
But Dad still knew, and cried on the phone with her.
It was the first time in 22 years that Xiao Zhu had seen his father cry.
Reporter: You (to the camera) to the family to report a peace.
She turned her back in a difficult way, and she looked up, smiled hard, and said, I don't want to cry, my tears are ringing in my eyes, but I can't cry, the goggles can't do anything. I am sorry.
Many people saw this video, all said: My tears also in the eye circle.
Oh, yes. Her words were clearly so plain, but how moving she was.
A 22-year-old girl could have been on a leisurely date in a coffee shop.
But she rushed to the front line, put on a war robe, against the big black circle, for the people of the whole country to fight.
Let's remember the girl. She is as beautiful as a flower, as brave as a warrior, and as kind as an angel.
Thank you, girl.
May you have a bright future.
I hope you can be a role model for more young people.
0 6Her name is Wang Xiaoxuan, is also a first-line anti-epidemic doctor.
She has been staying in a hotel for this time to protect her family from infection.
At 3 a.m. on February 6th, she was going to work. It was raining and my husband wanted to drive her.
She is afraid of infecting her husband and is afraid to get in the car.
So my husband drove all the way, turned on the lights, slowly followed her, silently escorting.
Say a word for her husband:
Never thought we'd go this way together.
Honey, you walk slowly.
The road ahead is hard, and I'll always be behind you!

He is a military doctor.
Behind someone else's protective suit, written in his own name, and behind him, it is written: Aunt Hubei.
Because his wife is from Hubei, he wants to indicate this identity, so that patients feel more cordial, more relaxed.
The details are in the heart.
Behind the simple four words is a doctor's considerate and kindness to the patient.
A doctor like this, I don't believe he will be bad for the patient.

The front couple are doctors at Shenzhen Central Hospital.
This time anti-epidemic, the couple are on the front line. From the beginning of the twenty-eighth year, busy to the present.
A few days ago, after the doctor was busy at work, he wanted to give some supplies to his parents and 3-year-old daughter.
In order to prevent his daughter from recognizing him and letting him go, he had to dress himself up as a courier.
He put things on the doorstep, a meter away, and his father simply confessed two sentences, and hurried away.
He wanted to meet his daughter, but... Or go.
Figure 2 photos, at first glance want to laugh, turn to the heart and heart.
We usually listen to more "She Xiaojia for everyone" this sentence.
However, whose small home is not their own concern, who is willing to give up, their own children refused thousands of miles ...
Send you that song of Xu Fei:
I respect you so scars are so serious
The mountains and waters are still struggling to figure out
I respect you thousands of heartbreak and hide a kiss
The dark clouds are rolling and the clouds are rolling. . .

Hankou Hospital, Wuhan.
A doctor and husband are on the front line to fight the epidemic, the daughter was sent back to their hometown, to relatives to take care of.
The husband was unfortunately infected and lived in the ward next to his wife.
But for a week, the wife couldn't bear to visit her husband.
The reason is heartbreaking: to see a husband, to wear protective clothing. She knew that protective clothing was tight and she couldn't afford to waste one.
This outbreak, like a magnifying glass.
Let us find out that in this world, good people are good, bad people are really bad, stupid people are really stupid, good people are really good.
Thank you, good angel, good people must be safe.

Protective clothing this thing, a lot of people do not understand.
It is a one-time, the cost is relatively high, is still in short supply.
So the medical staff are particularly treasured. Every time you put on protective clothing into the quarantine area, four or five or even seven or eight hours, you can not eat, drink water, go to the toilet, otherwise it will waste a set.
They are basically dressed as adults with urine not wet, continuous work.
A female doctor cried and said that many girls can't go to the toilet when they are physically in their life, their pants are wet...
Another reporter said that on one occasion a male doctor was seen standing motionless in the quarantine area, trying to say hello to him.
As a result, the male doctor said: Don't talk, or I will not come out of urine...
Too much hardship is unimaginable to us outsiders.
A few days ago, someone on the Internet was sunbathing in their hospital doctor's sleeping style:
Don't want to attract a lot of follow-up.
The theme of the photo contest "They're asleep" saw a lot of people crying.
In addition to sleeping postures, there are doctors' hands:
Their faces:
What white angel, but ordinary people put on a war robe. Learn the look of the predecessors, and the death rob people ...
A thousand words, choked in the throat.
In addition to a thank you, I really do not know what to say.

An aunt was diagnosed, and the doctor has been taking good care of it.
Aunt grateful, said: I really thank, thank you...
The doctor said, No, this is all we should do.
Aunt shakes her head: No, that's not what you should do.
Yes, that's the last sentence, and that's what I want to say.
No one, on the storm, on the courage and fearlessness, on the family house, on the selfless dedication.
Nothing, you have to do.
And you have done, we are deeply grateful, and remember in mind.

On February 10, a sad news came from Wuhan: Dr. Lin Zhengbin of Tongji Hospital, who died of new crown pneumonia, was 60 years old.
He is the 8th medical worker to die in the new corona outbreak.
They all did their best and fell on the battlefield.
Deplored.
This time, and many times in the past, the medical staff are suffering from unbearable weight.
They were the weak bodies of the text, but when the great war came, they made a hard and determined effort to protect our God.
How much hard is unknown.
I can only write down these little things one by one to be thankful for.
Finally, I want to rewrite that classic dialogue:
"Doctor, what do you want to do here?" "
"War disease, save the life!" "
"If you don't go back?" "
"You'll never go back!" "
This is your ambition.
And we, only hope that you will win, peace and victory!
Praise for the medical staff!
Tribute to the medical staff!

40. Your Information Pipeline Determines Your Destiny
Original Tong Dahuan Dahuan Eyes the City and Real Estate
- 24 responses to unidentified viruses
Wen/Tong Da-hwan 2020.2.15
【1】
A sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus has ravaged Shenzhou, sweeping the globe. It was suddenly discovered that at critical moments, information was at stake.
In fact, information is of the utmost importance in a person's life. What kind of information pipeline and information processing power, determine the TA in peacetime is confused or understand, is poor or rich, the key moment, it directly determines the survival of himself and his family.

We pull the camera back to SARS in Beijing 17 years ago. "We can't fall any more" tells the tragic story of the first SARS source recorded in Beijing:
In mid-February 2003, 27-year-old Taiyuan girl Xu Li was going on a business trip to Guangdong.
She was a little worried before she went out. At that time, it was rumored that Guangzhou was making a strange disease, the incubation period is very short, quickly developed into respiratory failure, no cure. Many medical personnel have also been infected.
Xu Li's mother works for a party newspaper in Taiyuan. She specifically checked some newspapers and called her colleagues working in Guangzhou to learn that they were all rumors.
Xu Li's 53-year-old father went online to check, see experts also said: atypical pneumonia is the lightest type of pneumonia, there is no fatal danger.
On February 18, Xinhua news agency sent a message saying that the CDC had identified SARS as a chlamydia. This became the official SARS "not terrible" and "controlled" medical evidence. On February 18th, 20,000 people went to Tianhe Stadium to see Luo Dayou's Guangzhou concert.
Also on February 18th, Xu Li took some plate blue roots with him and went to Guangdong.
After returning to Shanxi on the 23rd, she had a fever of 38.8 degrees. She said to the doctor of a big hospital in Taiyuan: "I came back from Guangzhou, will you get SARS?" "The doctor smiled and told her, "Don't make a fuss."
Later in Taiyuan five days, Xu Lixuan transferred several major hospitals, the diagnosis is a cold or normal pneumonia, will not be contagious.
On March 1, Xu Li, who had a high fever, was transferred to Beijing 301 Hospital. Soon, several medical care patients in Taiyuan were infected. Xu Li's mother and father were also infected and her condition deteriorated rapidly.
Since the 301 hospital is not an infectious disease hospital, they were transferred to the 302 hospital. The transport vehicle is not protected withany protection.
Since then, 301 hospital and 302 hospital sonof more than 10 medical staff were infected, becoming the first batch of medical staff in Beijing to be infected. SARS was also taken from 302 hospitals to Tianjin and Inner Mongolia.
On March 7, Xu Li and her mother were told that their father had been transferred to hospital. The truth is that he died.
Her mother also died on March 15.
At that time, xu Li family is not a "well-informed person"? Absolutely! But their information pipeline is too single.
A single message will result in you knowing nothing about the world.

Seventeen years later, the Internet has gained great development in China, and the four major sources of information and shopping for microblogging, WeChat, Alipay and online shopping have become the main information pipelines of the Chinese people and the main means of communication, payment and shopping.
At the end of 2019, an outbreak of the new coronavirus struck. In the case that everyone is completely ignorant of it, and even the vast majority of Chinese are completely in the dark, there is a man named Chen Qizhi, in the capital airport received a weChat alert from an important friend, immediately take measures. He wrote later in an article entitled "For a man who can't write a public name, I cried all night" (and thus estimated that it was written on the evening of February 6, 2020) (with an adjustment before and after the retelling):
(2019) December 31, my father's birthday, I took my daughter back to Enshi through Wuhan, before boarding a plane in Beijing I received a reminder from an important friend, received is Li (Wen) bright warning of pneumonia WeChat screenshots. On the same day, we are wearing masks all the way back, when I gave up to go to Wuhan, diverted high-speed rail to Chongqing to fly back to Beijing.
Since January 28, I have been with many friends around the world to buy masks, to buy protective clothing, to buy goggles, to buy all the new crown pneumonia needs for scarce supplies, some friends do not understand, said why I hit chicken blood to do this thing. Today I must say why: I, also owe Li ( Wen) bright ...
In the past ten days, all our work has revolved around the purchase of medical supplies on the front line of Hubei, at home, abroad, from Canada in the United States to the Middle East in Europe, we are frantically searching for all the standard medical supplies, we have only one purpose, to find these things, buy them and bring them back, To the first-line medical care who need these supplies most. In wartime it is the soldiers who protect our lives, and in peace, the doctors are protecting our health. They've done everything in this war against the virus, and we can't let them go to the thunder with their bare hands. The wind and snow were in the air, but the only way to warm the group.
Looking back on this matter now, Chen Yizhi at that time, with a low cost, took some of the situation at that time seemed likely to "make a fuss", "over-reaction" measures, but it is possible to avoid a major disaster.

At 22:54 p.m. on January 31, 2020, media reported that the study had initially found that double yellowing could inhibit the new coronavirus. That night, the major e-commerce platform double yellow even once out of stock, the line also appeared to buy a rush, many pharmacies lined up a long line.
Although the media issued a micro-blog call the next day: inhibition does not mean prevention and treatment! Special reminder: Do not rush to take their own double yellow even oral solution. But then someone went on to buy double yellow company.
On February 15, Zhengzhou Municipal Health Committee announced two confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia, which showed that one of the confirmed cases was from February 1 to February 14, and only walked to the pharmacy on February 2 to buy double yellow lian, and the rest of the time did not go out at home.
After the announcement, many netizens speculated that it was infected with the virus during the time of going out to buy double yellow company.
In this regard, the reporter contacted the Central Plains District CDC, Central Plains District Health And Health Committee and other units to verify, the answer is not yet able to determine. Central Plains District Health And Health Committee related workers said that the confirmed case is how to be infected, the disease control department through epidemiological investigation to study the results to be finally released. (2020-02-16 06:32 Source: China News Network)
Some may wonder why it's right to wear a mask and avoid "overreactions" like Wuhan on December 31, 2019? Is it wrong to buy double yellow even such "overreactions" as medical doctors?
Because the former is urgent, the latter is not urgent, the former is in line with the arrival of infectious diseases need to "effective isolation" of common sense, the latter does not meet the "viral infectious diseases without special drugs" common sense, and the outbreak of infectious diseases to try to as little as possible to go to the hospital and pharmacies, but also to reduce to crowded areas.
If the latter had more than a few information channels, such as "Dr. Lilac" and other information channels, it would not be credulous to double yellow and so on. On the morning of February 1st, I reminded several families not to believe in double yellow, and most of my family did not believe in double yellow.

The outbreak forced many people to become Sherlock Holmes. But some are detectives, so that they and their families to avoid injury; The long-term accumulation of information pipelines for each individual is very, very important!!! The more people in the information pipeline, the stronger the information advantage, the stronger the independent thinking ability, the stronger the ability of information analysis and processing power, the more insight into the truth, the better the ability to obtain the advantage of choice.
First of all, we do not encounter anything, we expect an authoritative media or authoritative institutions, authoritative figures can suddenly give the truth. Police cases, media investigations, and scientists cracking viruses all have a gradual cognitive process that can go detours and make mistakes. Moreover, different people, different positions, opinions and methods, see, describe, want to tell you, are not the same.
So we shouldn't be afraid of misinformation, don't be afraid of rumors. Don't expect to have a god of all knowledge, omnipotence, and all virtue, to give you all the truth in an instant. There is no possibility.
The truth needs to be dug by each of us. Yes, everyone, themselves.
If we are able to sift through, screen, and then choose what you believe in in a wide range of information, then you are responsible for your own choices, and you are only your own.
Second, we must be inclusive of negative and pessimistic messages that we don't like. The instinct of human nature is to be happy and forget, people naturally will reject negative, pessimistic information. But many times, the negative, pessimistic information is precisely the information age of chicken hair letter and fire tower, remind us of the need to be vigilant in the progress.
For example, on January 23, 2020, Guan Wei's interview with the media issued "SARS ten times jump," "I have done deserters," "people who have been to Wuhan to isolate themselves" and other "alarm." Not to mention that his prediction was quickly confirmed, even if not later confirmed, his warning to cause more people to self-isolation and objectively reduce the infection rate, but also for people's life and health has a great deal of credit.
Strategically, be optimistic; Kafka said: "Intelligent people, have always been pessimists, because pessimism, only want to change everything, optimistic people are often superficial hedonists."
Cao Lin, my colleague at the China Youth Daily, wrote a very good article in this article, "If that's a rumor, how many rumors people have made in more than ten days":
During this time, in the face of disease and the threat of the virus, people feel powerless and confused like never before. This time, how many before the "we love to listen" optimistic judgment, by the severe prevention and control of the facts false, and how many were previously seen as "disturbing the military heart", we do not like to listen to the pessimistic judgment, but ultimately was confirmed. It reminds us that we must not be conceited before nature. Those apparently malicious disinformation should, of course, be beaten up in accordance with the law, but "untrue" based on information and cognitive limitations should be tolerated, especially when such statements come from professionals. Don't you see? Many places have already paid a heavy price for this conceit and intolerance. Treat all ill-judged judgments as rumors, and science is stifled.
Humans have a rational conceit that they have largely mastered the truth and the truth, which is manageable, that preventable; this is a rumor, that is a rumor, can not let go of any thing that does not fit the "fact" of the message; the unknown virus ruthlessly repairs people's deadly conceit, all kinds of conceit, one after another before the cunning virus defeated the including the conceit of power, the conceit of experts, and the conceit of public opinion.
A lot of information, authoritative experts can not make a judgment, let alone ordinary people? All that can be done is to break the conceit and make information fully transparent and flowing, so that people can distinguish and judge in a transparent information environment.

Friends circle, classmate groups often will occur huge to irreconcilable tear, classmates, friends, fellow people are not happy and scattered, cut the robe of the matter almost every day in the occurrence. The reason is that the point of view is different, the source of information is different.
The ultimate goal of screening and analyzing information is the pursuit of truth. What kind of information pipeline a person has accumulated, how to deal with information correctly and effectively, determines his way of thinking, determines his final attitude, method and choice. If the information channel is narrow and single, it is the doctor will become silly.
"Online circulation of a sentence: 'education is a bronze medal, ability is a silver medal, people are gold medals, thinking is ace. 'I think this sentence is also very appropriate for the state, resources, military, science and technology, and even the role of the system is less than the national thinking ability. The system is the product of civilization, not the source, the national thinking is. (Li Xiuwen, "The Only Ethics of Disaster Literature, Is Reflections on Disaster")
Again: The ultimate goal of screening and analyzing information is to pursue the truth. In order to pursue the truth, each of us, usually consciously abandon those problems on the blame of others conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy, consciously abandon those who only fight chicken blood dare not face the negative pessimistic information of the "zh-ng energy." Because conspiracy theories and zhng energy "are usually deliberately distorting and covering up the truth, allowing you to live on emotions rather than making more objective, rational thinking and choices."

At present, many Chinese medicine have come forward to announce how effective it is. In the United States and France, "sympathetic drug" conditions, each treata patient, before January 21 by the Wuhan virus research that "can effectively inhibit the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro", in early February was also introduced by China's publicity for three clinical trials of Redsiewe, Has always stated that they have not obtained a listing license in any country, but also told everyone that the clinical results of the trial have not yet come out.
The true: the more pragmatic and often silent, the more noisy and often bubble.
Some people say: "Whether a drug is effective, it must go through in vitro cell tests, animal experiments, Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, in order to prove." At the moment only Redsey way to follow the process, April 27 can produce the final result, so it never claims to be effective. And in Wuhan major hospitalemergence treatment programs, often a variety of drugs, especially traditional Chinese medicine are claiming to be effective, you do not know whether the patient is new coronary pneumonia or ordinary pneumonia, whether the patient's immune auto-cure or drug treatment played a role. "
That's why, the more rigorous the more silent it is. The double-blind experiment of the drug is meticulous. Otherwise, placebos and psychotherapy can sometimes have a effect.
What do you mean a double-blind experiment? It's clinicians and patients who don't know what medicine to use. Only investigative researchers know. As a contrasting placebo, the dosage, color, smell, taste, etc. were identical to the experimental drug.

This virus disaster, three-point natural disaster seven people disaster. Many people scold the police, scold CCTV, scold scientists. It's all right, because when the avalanche, not a snowflake is innocent. But there are mistakes, because can not find the root cause of the words, looking for a replacement will not be progressive.
Based on the timeline of the reactions of various institutions, I found on February 11th that the coronavirus has four main characteristics: the virus travels faster than information reporting speeds, information is reported faster than Hong Kong and Singapore, Hong Kong and Singapore are responding faster than scientific research, and scientific research (identifying genes, Separated strains) to be shared globally faster than information is disclosed.
Well, that's it.
【9】
As to where the virus escaped, it's the last thing I can understand in this outbreak. Both positive and negative views and news I have seen a lot, but I can not judge, the original English paper I will not check, will not read, do not understand English can not understand the esoteric genetic sisis.
Well, what do you do? My approach is: to maintain the positive and negative views of the equality of attention, not casual letter, not casual lying, not casual spray. Look at which point of view can convince me in the end.
Most of the articles speculate that the article uses exclusion (not from the seafood market, so where does it come from?). ), or joint ideas (the Ministry of Science and Technology, the parties do not have photos, etc.), are just the source of negation in the seafood market, and then "Lenovo" to a certain place.
However, to deny a conclusion, only one counterexample is required to prove a conclusion, but all counterexamples should be excluded. Proving a conclusion is more than denying a conclusion, which is 100,000 times harder.
There are also some articles broken obviously, directly excluded. For example, Cui Cui Yongyuan's "I'll tell you three stories..." with a historical story to tell a chest-packing ticket is not reliable. This analogy is not possible. History has been to beat the chest of the heart!

41. "Fancy Isolation after the Evacuation of Overseas Chinese: French Romantic Vacation, Russian Hard Nuclear Exile, British 007 blockbusters!" Japan free "small movie"...
There's a hole in the hole.
Source: Japanese Design Station
As the outbreak continues,
Wuhan's medical resources are becoming increasingly stretched
From the end of last month
Individual countries begin to evacuate overseas Chinese from Wuhan
Spoofed nuts fear the safety of expatriates
It makes sense to call home, too.
But the way each country is evacuated and segregated
It's just a lot of bright spots.
Each became a famous scene.
Japan : Most Human
There are about 600 expatriates in Wuhan, Japan.
Returned home in batches on a contracted All Nippon Airways aircraft
To mention in particular,
Even if you don't acquire Japanese nationality,
As a family member of an expatriate, you can also go with you.
It's just very human!
The isolation is a warm accommodation area.
It's no different from the average Japanese resident's.
During isolation, medical staff will take regular temperature measurements.
and will keep the meal at the door at the time required.
From the picture
Morning salmon lunch meal night fried chicken
Food can also be
But when it comes to Japan's segregated diet,
We had to turn our attention to the Diamond Princess.
Number of confirmed people on cruise ships is on the rise
None of the remaining passengers went through human purgatory.
To calm the passengers' emotions,
Valentine's Day the day before
The ship's backchef prepares the day's surprise desserts for passengers
The Japanese government commissioned SoftBank and another company.
Give passengers a free new iPhone
Just return it when you disembark.
According to Global News.
An adult website announced
To all isolated cruise ship passengers
Free small movies
But presumably the rest of the passengers are long gone.
Don't do this at the head of the crisis.
Getting off the ship as soon as possible is the right thing to do!
France: Holiday-style isolation
For france, a romantic country,
The way to evacuate is also like a dream
Even if it's a group plane,
The general process of getting off to the settlement for two weeks
But the point is where they're isolated.
It's not average at all.
The French government placed them in a
A resort called Cary-le-Rouet.
Located on the most famous blue coastline in Provence, France.
It sounds a little beautiful, isn't it?
Let's take a look at this reality picture.
It's a resort.
Beautiful environment supporting facilities and full
The French government probably didn't think of it.
A settlement plant edifice for people all over the world.
But it's isolated here.
The mask is still to be worn.
It's just that everyone can go outdoors.
And doctors monitor them every day.
The gendarmes will be here to keep order.
Isolation conditions for such "holiday"
Solomon, head of the French health sector, explains:
The reason for choosing such a place to isolate
because we need a comfortable place.
The space has to be big enough.
They're not sick.
should stay in such a place.
The French man who has worked hard for half a year is estimated to have worked hard
After seeing this scene,
I'm already doubting life...
England: Too many plays!
Britain is probably the most nervous of the countries.
From the evacuation to the isolation point placement
The whole process is like a spy movie.
It's said that on the return plane,
It's equipped with military doctors and air force personnel.
After the plane arrived at the British air base,
All roads in the entire village nearby were temporarily closed.
On a bus from the airport to the settlement.
all equipped with a medical staff in protective clothing
The whole one was wrapped into A Michelin.
Better than our front-line personnel.
The escort steam is also spectacular.
Police cars, ambulances, motorcycle escorts
Feels like the next second James Bond is coming out.
Their isolation is in a hospital staff building.
Long before the quarantine personnel arrive.
I'm starting to move supplies inside.
Look still nervous can't
In addition to living and medical supplies
There's even a variety of game consoles
and Barbie dolls and other large car children's toys
The isolated place doesn't look like a room.
But the facilities are quite complete.
It is said that the kitchen washing machine Wi-Fi should have
There's a public entertainment area.You can play billiards when you're all right.
Seems to be having a good time.
But even so.
Or someone's going to start "doing things."
A man went on a drunken run after getting drunk.
But after knowing that the extra food would cost you,
Instant calm doesn't give up.
Germany: Too serious!
If Britain is making 007 blockbusters,
Then the German withdrawal was an act of the right thing.
And an exclusive action code "Lotus.
Even though the Germans look edified, they're serious.
But the Iron Man also has tenderness.
On the evacuation plane arriving in Wuhan
And 10,000 protective suits were donated to China.
(External cold heat is really attractive)
It is reported that all German expatriates will be off the plane
sent to a closed gym for a physical examination
People who pass the inspection
And then sent to the military base for 14 days of isolation.
As for the place of formal isolation,
Simple upper and lower bunk with a TV
There's nothing extra.
From evacuation to resettlement is low-key and rigorous
Yes, it's very German.
Russia: The hardest core!
But speaking of the big man in this evacuation,
That's russia, where there's not much to talk about.
Last week, Russia sent two military aircraft back and forth.
128 nationals and 16 citizens of CIS countries
Evacuation from Wuhan
Although military aircraft do not have civil aircraft pay attention to comfort
But from the pictures that the Russians are getting,
The conditions are too tough, too.
I can't see it's on the plane.
Everybody's huddled together.
Sitting on a hard bench.
Not even a window.
There's no even a seat belt.
What's more,
The toilet turned out to be a small tent.
Let people would rather hold on than dare to enter
But what's even more incredible is that
After a lifetime of flights,
These Russians might not have imagined
One day, i'll be on the land of the country.
Was suddenly exiled...
The place of "exile" is a nursing home in the Siberian forest.
Surrounded by fences around the nursing home.
and strictly guarded by the soldiers of the Russian National Guard.
Where is this isolation?
It's clearly going to be in prison.
Uniform clothing was also distributed.
One of them is a little sister with a good figure.
and wearing this suit, the power of the big picture
Sure, good-looking people look good at what they wear.
But good thing is that it's a nursing home in itself.
The facilities in the room are perfect.
Double room, en suite bathroom, microwave
There are all kinds of snacks and fruits coming in every day.
Probably sleeping enough to drink and bored to the end
Isolated people begin to try every means to relieve loneliness.
Fitness
Catwalk
Even started the webcast.
Document your isolation
Describe your living environment
Share your three meals a day
Live doctor's door-to-door check-up
Keep the boring and boring of life in isolation
It's been a Siberian momo meter.
As live video goes viral,
Russia's hard-core isolation
On the microblogging hot search
But under the outbreak,
Some people say
Other countries are donating supplies to China.
Why didn't you hear about the Russian donation?
But what did that say?
Russia is always a hard-nosed man.
Since the outbreak began,
Russia has sent relief supplies to China three times.
The most recent direct delivery
More than 23 tons of various medical personal protective equipment
Donations are generally by volume
Russia uses "tons" directly
A total of 36.2 tons of medical supplies have been donated.
Fill the cabin of an airplane with a full
And the friendly Russian people
I heard someone ask them.
How to donate the material on the quiet left
They answered:
"Economic sanctions in 2014 led to a 50% devaluation of the ruble
A lot of Russians have lost their jobs and houses.
Old people who rely on pensions can't even afford food.
At that time, only China
$400 billion gas order for Russia
Help us through this."
"We Russians are not good at smiling at strangers.
Russians don't like to smile to strangers.But we don't need friends to say thank you to us.
A friend is a friend. "
China refuels!
You are in our hearts."
And these two days
Russian thousands cheer for China Video
It's also spreading fast on the web.
Thousands of people in the video Chinese chant "China refuels"
Shouting "China, Russia with you" in Russian
Many netizens are deeply moved by reading
Someone once joked
Russia's donations won't go on hot sizzing
It's because I didn't read poetry.
But whether it's a poem,
Or straight-chested.
All the blessings and help for China
We should all sincerely thank you.
Home is the smallest country, the country is a million
And the world is everyone's home.
I hope that thousands of families can be safe and sound
I believe we're joining hands.
will be able to get through this!

42. Academician Yu Daiming: No good medicine has been produced in the world in the last 50 years, it is poison
Economic Reference Sinself Repair Researcher 2019-07-21
He is a well-known Western medicine, known as "China's first digestive medicine", a number of achievements shook the global medical community. Standing at the forefront of Western medicine, he repeatedly "strong" Chinese medicine, but thus attracted criticism and even verbal attacks.
He is a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, so far published in foreign countries THE number of SCI papers and citation rate in the domestic first. But he felt that medicine was getting closer to science, but farther and farther from the "patient".
He is a deputy ministerial-level leading cadre and a general. Weekday work is extremely heavy, but where there is a little time, whether on the road on business or in the office, then write down the pen to think of the gains, accumulated over time to write continuously, dare not claim to be "word beads" but must "word original".
In particular, he was awarded this year's National Science and Technology Innovation Team Award at the National Science and Technology Awards conference on January 9.
......
He is a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Vice President Yu Daiming. One afternoon in beijing,000 in the deep winter of Beijing, Yu Daiming gave an exclusive interview to a reporter from the Economic Reference Daily in the office of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Why is he strong in Chinese medicine? The road of the development of modern medicine is somewhat biased, where is the road? How Chinese medicine contributes to the development of medicine... Yu Daiming's answer is crisp and sharp, full of infectious. One question and one answer, an afternoon time unknowingly flow away, the whole process actually did not have any external disturbance.
Traditional Chinese medicine is comparable to modern medicine and is irreplaceable!
Economic Reference Daily: You are a well-known Western medicine, the depth of understanding of Chinese medicine, in today's mainstream medical field is not very common, and your support for Chinese medicine, more well known. At a recent forum on grading and diagnosis, we noted that your speech began with the vigorous development of Chinese medicine and the promotion of the construction of graded diagnosis and treatment. Why are you so strong at Chinese medicine?
Yu Daiming: In fact, Chinese medicine does not need to "quite", it itself "quite" for thousands of years, we need to learn well. Chinese medicine is not to deny Western medicine; In this regard,
I have four sentences: First, in the history of mankind, Chinese medicine has never been emphasized and respected as it is today; Fourth, Chinese medicine is bound to become the main contributor to the future medical development and integration of medicine.
Economic Reference: How to understand these four sentences?
Yu Daiming: First look at the first sentence. President Xi Jinping has a highly generalized and incisive assessment of Chinese medicine, which embodies profound philosophical wisdom and thousands of years of healthy and physiological thinking and practical experience of the Chinese nation, is a treasure of ancient Chinese science and the key to opening the treasure trove of Chinese civilization.
This is the party and the country's top leaders of Chinese medicine unprecedented evaluation! The 2015 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology, the researcher of Tuyu, is the international mainstream medical community's recognition of the value of Chinese medicine, this degree of recognition is unprecedented!
Second sentence. In the history of human civilization, all kinds of medicine continue to produce and die out, only Chinese medicine has a complete theoretical basis and clinical system, through the wind and rain, continuous development and perfection, for the Chinese nation to make great contributions to the growth and expansion.
Even at a time when Western medicine is dominated, Chinese medicine is still with its remarkable efficacy and unique charm, and has set off a long-standing "Chinese medicine fever" in more and more countries.
Even in some fields, Chinese medicine is far ahead of modern medicine. For example, for stubborn diarrhea, Western medicine has not been an effective means, until in recent years in foreign countries the rise of the treatment of enterobacteria transplantation, only significantly improved the efficacy. And thousands of years ago, Chinese medical books such as "Behind the Elbow" "Yellow Emperor", and even earlier, there are records of "oral fetal feces" and other similar therapies.
For example, modern medicine believes that human life is the strongest at 12 noon and the weakest at 12 o'clock at night. When I was a resident on the night shift when I was young, I found that the number of patients who died in the middle of the night was the highest. Isn't this the internationally recognized "meridian note" of our Chinese medicine?
If you look at the third sentence, there are numerous examples in this area in the clinic. For example, Western medicine emergency abdominal surgery can solve the emergency to save people's lives, but after surgery, the ether alflate is sometimes difficult to solve, seriously affecting the effect of surgery. Acupuncture can be done! When Nixon visited China, an American journalist came to China to stand before, and unfortunately had a sudden appendicitis and had surgery at Concord Hospital. The operation itself was very successful, but after the operation of the ealthing gas can not be resolved, and later is acupuncture to solve. After returning home, the reporter wrote a report that responded with great repercussions, directly promoting acupuncture to enter the United States and many other Western countries.
In the fourth sentence, Chinese medicine is bound to become the main contributor to the future medical development and integration of medicine. The road of the development of modern medicine is somewhat biased, closer and closer to "science" and farther from "patients", and medical research is becoming more and more entangled in microscopic, farther and farther away from the whole. Modern medicine needs to learn from Chinese medicine to help itself "correct". On this basis, the integration of the two can form a whole, focus on "people", really effective to ensure human health of the new medical system.
We Western medicine can not and should not look down on Chinese medicine! As for some of the arguments that don't know much about science, and don't care too much. Some people say that the more clear the truth, I think to practice to speak, the effect of speaking!
The Nobel Prize in Medicine is awarded only to microscopic researchers? There's a problem!
Economic Reference: Why is the development of modern medicine somewhat biased?
Yu Daiming: For example. Came a patient with liver cancer, but in the doctor's mind, always think that this is a person's liver has long cancer, focus on the liver this organ, especially on the liver long tumor. "Cancer patient" was originally "the person with cancer", but now it has "a person has a cancer".
So, the removal of the tumor, the removal of the tumor-grown organs, even the surrounding disease-free tissue and lymphhaveu have been removed, the result of the tumor cut, the patient died, in fact, it is possible that he is still alive. There are too many examples like this.
This is one of the "biased" appearances of modern medicine - "the patient becomes an organ". Because the branch is too fine, doctors pay attention to the "self-administered" organs, each pay attention to the "self-administered" lesions, and finally each of them "self-administered" organs or "self-administered" organs on the "self-administered" lesions cured, the patient died.
You see, every doctor is doing the right thing, but partial correctness results in the overall incorrect result.
In addition, there are "disease becomes symptoms," "clinical becomes a test," "doctor becomes pharmacist," "psychological and physical separation," "heavy treatment light prevention" and so on.
Since the invention of the microscope in the 17th century, medicine has developed rapidly from macro to micro, and soon it will divide medicine into basic medicine, clinical medicine, preventive medicine and so on. Basic medicine first divides people into how many systems, organs, tissues and even cells, subcells, molecules (proteins, DNA, RNA) ...
Clinical medicine is divided into internal medicine, surgery, specialty, and then subdivided into digestion, blood, heart, orthopaedics, general, ex-otrole and other three disciplines.
Now continue to be subdivided into "four levels", orthopaedics are divided into spinal, joint, limbs and other disciplines;
What's more, some people seem to think that is not enough, foreign countries also proposed "precision" surgery, do not know which tissue to be refined, which cells, which gene.
Modern medicine has developed to the present, with unremitting split into two characteristics, it seems that people as a whole to engage in a split, body difference, tearing heart and lungs, liver and intestines, spleen and stomach division never stop. Overemphasis on "points", the shortcomings of modern medicine and even the consequences are becoming more and more prominent.
Economic Reference: How to View the Relationship between Medicine and Science? Isn't medicine science?
Yu Daiming: I've never told anyone anywhere, any time, that medicine is not science! This should be based on words! I mean, medicine isn't just science, it can't be equated. Medicine contains science, but science is not all medicine, it is only part of medicine.
Science is the study of "dead" things, and the way is to study the linear relationship between two static things in an abstract way, is repeatable and universal.
Medical research is the most difficult human to explain the life phenomenon, not only pay attention to the high universality of things, but also pay attention to the human structure, function and disease heterogeneity or uniqueness. Scientific research is complex, the final law is "material indestructible", and medicine in addition to the substance is not extinguished, but also to answer why "life and death have a period."
Medicine is not just a single science, there are many other and more important parts as science, including philosophy, sociology, anthropology, art, psychology, environmental science, and so on. All methods related to people and human bodies, medicine should be taken over.
All said that Professor Gong good medicine, others can not cure him, others generally treat his effect is remarkable. Am I relying on science? Of course there is science, but sometimes even a lot of times it's not just science. Every time I go to check the ward, I first come in and talk to the patient first. Where's your village? What's this year? How's the harvest... As I left, I finally walked, gently brought the door, and said goodbye to the patient with a smile.
Don't look down on these details, what does the patient feel from it? Care, warmth, confidence! Because he has faith in you. Coupled with reasonable treatment, can the effect not be better? It's not just science, at least psychology, linguistics, etc. Therefore, in the medical process, science accounts for how much of the components, according to different time, place, people to determine.
Economic Reference: You say modern medicine is getting further and further away from people, i understand. But some people ask, technology continues to go deep into the micro-field, medicine is not helpful?
Yu Daiming: The development of science, especially the deepening of the micro-field, is helpful to the development of medical technology. I have published 600 SCI papers so far, do not understand this truth? However, to micro-exploration and in-depth, only and macro, the whole linked to medical development, to life and health is really meaningful, this is my experience as a doctor for more than 40 years.
For a long time, the mechanical view of life of restoration theory has profoundly affected the understanding of the nature of life - all life phenomena can be restored to physical chemical reactions, life phenomena are not complex, but the problem of the level of understanding.

The outbreak has given people an idea of the value of medical resources. To protect medical personnel and those in the field of medical technology is to protect the lives of others. However, the occupational specificity of medical staff also means that they are also at higher risk of infection.
On the afternoon of February 14th, at a press conference held by the State Council to deal with the outbreak of pneumonia, Zeng Yixin, deputy director of the National Health and Health Commission, said that as of 24 hours on February 11, medical personnel nationwide had confirmed 1716 cases of new coronal pneumonia, accounting for 3.8% of the confirmed cases, of which 6 died.

Old China Radio, daily highlights don't miss old Chinese radio station
Hello, listeners, welcome to the old China Radio program, I am Jun Jun, we first came to pay attention to today's San Francisco Bay Area local news, according to (? A child was slightly injured in a park where a giant mountain lion was slightly injured on Sunday morning as part of the pencil original space open district. (9? A statement was issued sunday afternoon that the park and open space reserve had been closed and that the reopening would have to wait for additional notice. The district said the child was at a distance from his parents last week morning. The child's parents, who were walking along a two-mile walk along the footpath, were seen driving away the animal, and an administrator treated the child with minor injuries at around 10am on Sunday, without specifying the nature and age of the child's injuries, which California is investigating. And is working hard to find the animal, open space public affairs experts said, see the mountain master and such an encounter is rare, generally does not pose a threat to people. They have a fear of loud noise and avoid areas of human activity, which is very rare, but (?? Mountains are its habitat, so people should be vigilant and conscious. If you see the mountain lion (? You should keep calm and make a loud noise and make yourself look tall. Then slowly back down.
Here's the news: While Port of Oakland remains busy and imports and exports are increasing, the new coronavirus scene is a view of port officials who remain a reservation about the future, port officials said Friday, comparing total imports from January 2019 to a 7.3 percent increase and an increase of 3.3 percent. The good news for port officials is that the U.S.-China trade war has cooled after China bought goods from U.S. farmers in January, and many farmers are moving goods to Asia through Oakland, as domestic and overseas consumer demand boosts port shipments. The bad news is that international travel and shipping have been hit hard since the outbreak of the new coronavirus in Wuhan, China, last December, with airline flight cancellations, travel restrictions and shipping cuts likely to dampen economic activity. The measures appear to have slowed the development of China's manufacturing industry to some extent and led some shipping companies to cancel recent shipping arrangements.
Port of Oakland or supervisor (?? Life in January will be a lonely one, but we have learned from shipping companies that shipments are likely to perform as well in the coming months, and port officials say it could take months to understand the impact of the virus outbreak on shipping and the overall economy.
Here's the news: As coronavirus concerns cause business to slide in Chinatown, The mayor of Oakland and business leaders are making aggressive calls to encourage people to shop and eat in Chinatown, and a woman at a Chinatown store says she sees a lot of rumors about the coronavirus on social media, which she fears will keep people away from Chinatown. The boss (? (?) says that usually the inside and outside seats are full, but this has not been the case recently,??? We say that this virus has a big impact on our restaurants because people from China say they leave the virus in our restaurants and there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Ukraine, and we know that there are many false rumors, and we know that people have a lot of fear.
Our business is hurting, (? Say, we're here to say it's time to support our business, Six visited the store in Chinatown and enjoyed some snacks. Efforts to block the wrong information are beginning to bear fruit, with some customers citing patronage rates as a sign of support for local businesses.
Here's the news: Is there anyone in the world who doesn't have action data or network connections, so they don't have the chance to use a web-based car? (? But not so, so the introduction of 1800 phone numbers to ask people to recruit people to talk about the shortage of cars, from the network car to the telephone booking means from the service industry to the transport industry, although the company said that the pilot new features are designed for the elderly. But anyone who wants to call to talk to a real person about a car reservation can call 1833, which is based on the seniors' response to the company, because they say timely conversations and simple experiences can make people's traffic needs different, but the feature is limited. It's about having at least one phone that can get the message. Because the subscriber will still send the necessary advice, newsletters, like the time of the ride, the license plate of the delivery, the name of the driver and other important messages. Or you may receive the necessary advice before the ride, and then rely on mobile phone newsletters to collect the cost and receipt of the ride.
That's life advice, and let's focus on the weather: The minimum temperature across the Bay Area this evening is between 40 and 45 degrees, and tomorrow's maximum temperature is between 61 and 68 degrees.
While Port of Oakland remains busy and imports and exports are increasing, the international impact of the new COVID-19 coronavirus has given port officials a cautious view of the future.
Port officials said Friday that total imports rose 7.3 percent last month and exports rose 3.3 percent from January 2019.
The good news, according to port officials, is that the U.S.-China trade war has cooled after China agreed in January to increase purchases from U.S. farmers, and many farmers are beginning to ship goods to Asia through Oakland.
In addition, domestic and overseas consumer demand has boosted cargo traffic at ports.
The bad news: International travel and shipping have been hit hard since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, last December, and airline flight cancellations, travel restrictions and quarantines could dampen economic activity.
Port officials say the measures appear to have slowed The Development of China's manufacturing industry to some extent and led some shipping lines to cancel recent shipping arrangements.
John Driscoll, head of maritime operations at Port of Oakland, said: "The increase in January was encouraging, but we have learned from shipping companies that freight volumes are likely to perform modestly in the coming months. 」
In addition, port officials say it could take months to fully understand the impact of the outbreak on global shipping and the economy as a whole.

46. More than 100 public officials who have been sacrificed on the front lines ...
10,000 Knives
The following article comes from talking about chicken breasts, the author chicken big breasts
Talk about chicken breasts
Talk about chicken breasts
Thanks for the attention.
The author of this article is my friend, his public name is called "talk about chicken big chest", ten thousand knife reprinted slightly modified.
So far, according to incomplete statistics, the number of public officials killed under the outbreak has reached more than 111.
And these 111 people, in addition to Dr. Li Wenliang, the rest of the little known.
Looking at the list of those who died in the line of duty, it was heart-wrenching and shocking.
The above list especially thanks the blogger All-True Taoist Liang Xingyang
I mentioned the list a week ago, when there were 54 people on the list, but who would have thought that there would be so many victims after the outbreak was brought under control and after many people began to relax.
I can't believe it, but these people really don't exist anymore.
The so-called quiet years, in addition to the first-line medical staff resolutely retrograde, there are countless front-line ordinary workers to carry the burden forward.
A man is inherently dead, either heavier than Mount Tai, or lighter than Hong Mao.
They died quietly, but the pressure on our hearts, they are very ordinary, but should become the hero of this era.
Weibo has a "build a new Great Wall with flesh and blood" super words, yes, they were once living, but in order to fight the epidemic with their own flesh and blood for us to build a new Great Wall.
They are a nurse, a policeman, a doctor, a security guard, a cadre, a worker, a villager, a volunteer, a common member in the tens of millions of people.
But is not unobtrusive an ordinary individual, keep the Quartet safe, protect us well.
He called Mao Qihong, stationed at a high-speed checkpoint to detect the body temperature was killed in the line of duty.
His son said that the day was not the father on duty, because the hospital staff is not enough, the initiative to apply for the top shift.
For the first time in three years, the family was reunited, but Chinese New Year's Eve had no time to eat and rushed to the front line of the epidemic.
At the time of his death, he kept talking about the staff around him to stick to their posts.
His name was Zhang Xinzhong, who died of a sudden heart attack on his way to fight the pneumonia epidemic.
Since 12 years as the director of the detention center, insist on doing the home, did not take a full holiday, did not take a holiday.
He's been in the house all his life and he's never been out again.
Former colleagues said that tearful reading of the new life story, lost a comrade-in-arms.
His name is Song Yingjie, zero after the handover of duty sudden cardiac sudden death.
Working ten days and nine nights in a row, that day colleagues shouted "Song Yingjie quickly get up to eat."
Because did not reply finally knocked on the door to see, found that this sunny handsome 9 young people have gone.
"Clothes white, broken loulan, Chizi remember peace also",
But he never went back.
His name is He Jianhua, the initiative to invite the people to the crowded bus station continuous work because of cerebellum haemorrhage treatment invalid martyrdom.
The otherwise happy family fell down.
But a few days later, his wife and daughter donated more than 5,000 yuan worth of protective equipment to the first line of epidemic prevention and control.
and said that he wanted to complete the unfinished work for him, walk the unfinished road.
His name is Ma Banning, on duty for 13 days 14 hours a day finally fell to the post unfortunately died. (I really couldn't find the hero photo)
He is actually a disabled man with an inconvenient right leg.
IN 2003 SARS, HIS PROTECTIVE TOOLS ARE VERY SIMPLE, IN THE ANTI-EPIDEMIC LINE CARRYING SPRAYERS THROUGH THE STREETS TO SPRAY DISINFECTION WATER.
Why did you suddenly take him this time?
Some heroes didn't even get a picture, and the sporadic news didn't get anyone's attention.
We seem to have forgotten them, or do not know that in this vast land in China, there are people fighting for their lives to protect us.
Who are they fighting for?
Who did they die for?
It's all of us.
We shouldn't forget.
They don't want to be heroes, they just go up a little bit and then a little bit, they just shine a little bit, they just try a little bit and then a little bit.
A grain of gray of the times, falling on the head of the individual, is a mountain.
So countless ordinary front-line workers to carry the mountain up, our ordinary people ushered in the day lying at home to contribute to the country.
We should know too well and remember every hero.
They all have names.

There are 26-year-old young men, but also 71 years old village branch books. Most people are fathers and mothers, and they should be happy and well-being, but they are separated from the people who love them.
Most of the causes of death are sudden illnesses.
To say that the white dot is the body overload edaddy, overworked death.
Many people have done things other than their duties, trying hard to use their own strength to shine a light on this society, but who can know this burning, directly burned out of life.
The doctor sat in the ICU ward told me that most people were reluctant and reluctant at the time of their death. Heroes must be the same, how willing they are to fall, how to give up the lovers of the warm embrace.
Wind Xiao Xiao is easy to water cold, the strong man went to return.
Most distressing of all, the deaths of more of them did not cause a stir, and were carried out by news reports, but they were the heroes who died fighting the epidemic.
Should never be forgotten.
What does the Great Saint go to,
Step south and the sky is broken,
If you don't go back,
I won't go back!
I would also like to say that those who have not been sacrificed are heroes who remain on the front line. Don't wait until the sacrifice, we are called heroes.
We'd rather these heroes live!
I have the honour to commemorate the public officials who lost their lives in the line of duty during the outbreak and to pay tribute to the public officials who have also fought on the front lines.

47. News 1 and 1 Today's Outbreak Response
Perhaps it is precisely because of this reason, from yesterday until tomorrow Wuhan is conducting a large-scale trawling, and the proposed goal is very clear: five hundred percent, let's see what five hundred percent
Wuhan to carry out three-day centralized pull-net-type large-scale troubleshooting
When: February 17--- 19
Requirements: Implementation of five "100%" work goals
Goal: 1, confirmed patients 100% should be due
2, suspected patients 100% nucleic acid testing
3, fever patients 100 percent to test
4, close contact 100 percent isolation
5, community villages 100 percent of the implementation of 24-hour closed management
What kind of pull-net-type check-up is that? Time has passed two days, next we are going to connect is our Wuhan Wuchang District Zhongnan Road Street Bai Ruijing Community Party Secretary Wang Yaling, but before the connection we first understand this community it is facing this challenge, pull the net-type large-scale check to face how many people; It is located in Wuchang District, Zhongnan Road Street, the number of households is 8424 households, the resident population of more than 21,300 people, the previously confirmed cases are 56 cases, the next immediately to connect with Secretary Wang.
Bai yan song wire king book: Secretary Wang Hello, in the course of two days of this inspection found a new fever or residents with this symptom?
Secretary Wang: Yes, we checked a suspected patient from yesterday's check-up
Bai Yansong: And then where to react to this, how fast is the reaction?
Secretary Wang: The patient with fever is because of the reflux of the gastroesophageal esophagus.
Our approach is first our door-to-door knock to check his family population, his family's health, including family information, and the second is that we will also remove them from those who do not live in our Bairui view. The third is to pat the door without responding to our residents we will again say that tomorrow this relative troubleshooting task is a little easier, we will repeat the door again to determine whether he lives in our community, the health of family members is normal?
Bai Yansong: What is the biggest difference between this pull-net large-screen check and your previous troubleshooting?
Secretary Wang: With us before check this, before the check is mainly by telephone, but now we are door-to-door, we are not missing a family, not miss a person, and then is our community network isolation personnel and lower party members and volunteer team, two people one team door-to-door knock.
Bai Yansong: Do not miss a person may also have residents do not cooperate will use such as not turning on the lights or other ways you this door does not open the door will also mobilize other people may use quotation marks to report or how to make you can also do.
Secretary Wang: There are such residents, so these uncontacted building numbers will be published, welcome residents to report to us, yesterday our QQ group inside there are residents told us that his next door is actually someone, at night there are lights at home, we will record it, and then again door-knocking, to ensure that every resident, Every family must contact us, not miss a family, not a person.
Bai Yansong: Is this the most difficult time in your community from the perspective of this outbreak? Or is it harder than before?
Secretary Wang: It should be more difficult, we were very, very hard before February 6th, when we felt the darkest, but now we feel that the concentration of this five categories of people will increase, our community in this area of our community will be a lot less stressed, What we are mainly doing now is to check and provide life support for the residents.
Bai Yansong: February 6th you talked about the toughest time you've had, because of what's so hard? What's the difficulty?
Secretary Wang: Before February 6th, the first is to focus on the treatment of this block of beds is very tight, resulting in some of our diagnosis, suspected not timely treatment, this is panic at home. So we came under pressure from all sides, and the manpower of the community workers was limited, so we had the hardest time during that time, but now we feel much better and we're getting through it.
Bai Yansong: Just now you used a word called "zero", this is not the focus of your work, what is "zero"?
Secretary Wang: Yes, zeroing is indeed the focus of our work, it should be said that our defense work is the first step, the current community has done is to confirm patients, suspected patients.
Connecting with The President of Wuhan University, Du Xiankang
White Rock Pine: Providing Related Support
Dou Xiankang: As you said just now, wuhan University's two hospitals bear the very important task of fighting the epidemic in Wuhan, as a university words we give him support mainly divided into the following aspects: the first words we through the support of science and technology, the use of the school's scientific and technological strength to assist the hospital and by our nucleic acid testing, Our academy has played a very good role in this regard. Second, we used alumni support, and ten days ago, under the condition of lack of material, we used alumni support to provide nearly 10 million masks, 590,000 protective clothing and 170,000 goggles to two hospitals in Wuhan University. The hospital has provided a lot of financial support. Because this time we secretary after the discussion, we decided that after the end of the epidemic in the title and title we will be to a large extent to the first line of doctors and nurses tilt. The tilt force is relatively large, not a double increase. This is our Wuhan University's support for two hospitals.
Bai Yansong: President Dou, after all, we have two medical schools and then there are a lot of students may be in the internship, regardless of whether he is a graduate student or how, this time there are young and did not graduate in fact the students of the school have been in the front line as medical staff in the struggle?
Dou Xiankang: Because directly engaged in medical work to have a doctor's quality, but we have a lot of students to take the initiative to fight, do some supportive work, including in the hospital isolation ward to do supportwork. There are also a large number of medical students to the community to help the community to the home isolation, home treatment to help and support.
Bai Yansong: President Dou, including today's tragic death of President Liu, we also have Wuhan University alumni in this epidemic prevention war to give their lives, as the school how to remember and commemorate them?
Dou Xiankang: You said this, I think, including the death of President Liu today, because we know that any death represents a father who lost his son, his wife lost his husband, and the child lost his father, so we hereby express our condolences. As Wuhan University we have produced many outstanding alumni, in this war against the epidemic more than one outstanding doctor like our Dean Liu gave his life. So as a school we will use our alumni strength and then make sure that the family lives of these doctors are protected, because we also call on our students to learn from their dedication. I think they are worth learning two things: their professionalism and professionalism. It's really worth learning forever.
Bai Yansong: President Dou that now in our Wuhan University we get the data is Wuhan University to stay in the total number of students is 796 people, including 57 undergraduates, 363 graduate students, 3 students from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, 373 international students, and so on, how can they now maximize to ensure their own safety? Has anyone been infected with this new coronal pneumonia?
Du Xiankang: The larger retention is 363 graduate students and 373 international students, as well as 57 undergraduates. And the 796 people you just said. The measures we do to protect our students are relatively in place. The first we guarantee disasured them one person and provide them with some necessary control equipment including masks, including thermometers. The second point we'll give them all the food to the bedroom, reducing their chances of getting as much infection as possible. Because some of the experiments that some graduate students give him can not be stopped, including that we have a lot of animals still need them to maintain, we have to tell him the necessary protection knowledge to avoid them infected, so far we are thankful that a master's student in the front line to help medical staff to be infected, None of the 796 students were infected. It's something we feel is worth the effort.
Bai Yansong: We have a large number of students in reading, in fact, it is also possible that some of the staff intend to go back and forth in advance or normal back to school, we in the past this period of time is to resolutely refuse us students to return to school at this time? They all follow the school's orders, right?
Dou Xiankang: Yes, we do this work to do fine, it played an advantage of our Wuhan University student team. Our counselors include head teachers, including department leaders, each of us division of responsibilities, specific to let them contact each student, tell them at this moment not to return to school is the greatest support for the anti-epidemic work in Wuhan. But we also do a good job of on-site teaching to make sure they have a sense of mission in their studies.
Bai Yansong: Yes, President Dou next is a very important key, because we can not start school now, but the student is actually he wants to carry out learning ah, from the point of view of Wuhan University now what kind of way to complete the students scattered throughout the country, and even around the world including our international students, What is the approach we use to carry out the relevant teaching?
Dou Xiankang: So our school is more important to this, we opened during the outbreak of the only party committee standing committee is 7 days, we have two one, one is to learn The General Secretary Of Xi and the provincial and municipal leaders of the instruction spirit and the deployment of work. Another one is that we are to arrange the recovery of our teaching work, we started teaching online yesterday. Universities know that in a simple talk about online teaching is not meaningful, we give the school's teaching the only request, is to have time, how to say? For example, we divide the course into two categories, one is the more difficult course, he through self-study, through simple teaching to enable him to complete the course. We record it through teacher scours, including through contextual itys, in the same way as in the classroom. After the recording, let them download the course in advance after self-study and then organize the classroom to discuss, deepen the students' understanding of the more difficult courses. Then there is a bigger part of the easier course, so we can give him PPT, pre-set some questions, give him some homework. Then we give him a fixed amount of time to discuss, so we have two approaches to achieve our teaching to achieve the desired goal. Judging from the one-day implementation yesterday morning, we opened 881 classes yesterday morning, with 22,000 students taking part in the event. The overall response is better.
Bai Yansong: That President Dou actually because now just started, I also heard the whole face of the country not only universities, but also primary and secondary schools in the opening of the relevant network classes also encountered some challenges, the need for some dynamic adjustment, Wuhan University in this regard how to prepare? Also make dynamic adjustments based on reality to make it work better to reach a higher rate of arrival?
Dou Xiankang: Yes, you are very right, for example, we now more difficult courses we have to take this way of broadcasting, to students first download the course, then he went through the necessary pre-study with questions to go to a public space we opened to discuss, so we after a period of time such a groping, We can find a more suitable way to teach students. So from the current two days of the situation, we found that there is a relatively large harvest, that is, the interaction between teachers and students is much better than the original traditional teaching.
Bai Yansong: President Dou actually has a very serious challenge, because every year to this time for our undergraduate or our graduate students are the key moment of graduation job. They may have to go to a lot of interviews, and then there are very enterprises, institutions to the campus to recruit people, but the arrival of the epidemic will end all of a sudden, for the children who want to graduate to find a job, the school to provide them with what kind of help?
Dou Xiankang: This problem is very good, after the outbreak came, now we Wuhan, the only thing our school can do is to try to open up some online recruitment channels to help students find work, so we may wait for the end of the epidemic we may increase the intention of bringing this enterprise to our Wuhan University, To ensure that Wuhan college students can get a satisfactory job after graduation.
Bai Yansong: Whether the work has already begun, if it does affect some students, this delay
Dou Xiankang: Has begun, yes, if the student graduation delay we have the way to improve, is what we are doing now is to do not affect the normal graduation of students.
Bai Yansong: President Dou also has a point may be a lot of people in the news when Wuhan University on February 12th to this year's University may want to report to Wuhan University students wrote an open letter, this letter is very touching, this is out of what kind of consideration? If you, as the principal, would like to say something to the children who are going to take the exam at Wuhan University, what would you like to say to them?
Du Xiankang: Because Wuhan University is the country's long history of the university, but also in China's top universities, so to recruit outstanding high school students to Wuhan is a very important task. In such a special period, we are also promoting Wuhan University, so that high school students understand that this is a hero city, this is a great university, we now have temporary difficulties, but we must be able to overcome these difficulties, so we still hope to let high school students know more about Wuhan University, I hope that more excellent high school students can come to Wuhan University this year to study.
Bai Yansong: What would you like to say to them through today's screen as principal?
Dou Xiankang: So I say Wuhan University is a university with all its deep cultural heritage, and the students of Wuhan University in the fight against the epidemic, including our alumni, have donated to several hospitals in Wuhan City and our alma mater, including the spirit of the doctors and nurses who work on the front line, and also show the self-improvement and Hongyi of Wuhan University. Seek to expand the new school training. So I say this is a university with all the deep cultural heritage, so I still hope that after the end of the epidemic the university can come to the beautiful East Lake trip, home to the Three Gorges, and we study and grow.
Bai Yansong: President Dou, in a letter to these high school students, also ended with the words "to become their hearts for heaven and earth, for the people to live." "I don't know if you've been thinking about this lately, how we at Wuhan University in the future will make this epidemic prevention of good spirits including character also make it a part of education." Let them leave Wuhan University with these things in the future.
Dou Xiankang: Yes, you are saying very well, in fact, this is a kind of spirit, not only to educate our future students, in fact, I think our teachers in school is also an education, including myself is a big education. In this struggle we have seen a lot of things that moveus us, as universities we are dedicated and professional skills. Put us must cultivate these five categories of students, with patriotic feelings, with professionalism, there are enough skills to complete the work we should complete.
Bai Yansong: Thank you very much for our president's interview, let's make a lot of people meet wuhan University to see the cherry blossoms after the outbreak.

Where are the boundaries of power and rights under the impact of the new crown epidemic?
Author: Wei Zhou
When the new corona outbreak will end, the light at the end of the tunnel has yet to be seen, but one thing seems to have become clear: it is far from just a public health event, but also a massive shock, correction, and change of the boundaries of the original power and power of Chinese society. For better or worse, this is happening, but what legacy it will leave is something we must face now. If these borders are not clarified at this opportunity, the current state of emergency may be perpetuated.
The empty dormitory and the welded door
In order to treat the isolated suspected patients, Wuhan urgently requisitioned student dormitories from several universities. This was a good thing, but it was shocking to see the video of Wuhan Software College roughly emptying the student dormitory. Every time at this time, there will always be a voice think, all this time, you personally suffered a point of grievance to calculate what? As many have already pointed out, the problem is that there is no relationship between "wronged" and improvement of the situation here, which is simply a disregard for individual rights.
However, such an argument, which many openly proclaim, still shows a general social mindset: in many people's eyes, "the big picture is the priority" and "general", there is no personal interest that cannot be sacrificed for the big picture , especially if it is the interests of others. This naturally legitimizes the violation of individual rights and interests, and often does not go, and it is too late to identify which initiatives are reasonable and legitimate. The result is often that under the noble name of "destroying the family to alleviate the hardship", the needless sacrifice, waste, "destroy the home", but it may not be much help to "relief".
Even in provinces such as Zhejiang, which had been praised for proper disposal, there were cases where suspected patients were locked and even welded to death, and Guangdong passed regulations to permit the expropriation of private property, which is in fact close to a wartime state, and public power, on the grounds of emergency, crossed the default boundaries of individual rights in the day-to-day. This is yet another reminder that the border is not only blurred, but also extremely fragile and easily breached.
Still, the younger generation's sense of entitlement is, after all, much stronger than that of the previous generation. The "Please Don't Kidnap Students with The Epidemic" video, which has 3.3 million views on Station B, has almost single-sidedly accused the school of ignoring student property. Despite the amount of "junk school" abuse, this emotional backlash itself indicates the awakening of people's sense of entitlement. From the students' appeal, as long as it does help to segregate patients, they do not object to the expropriation of dormitories, but rather oppose the rough practices in the expropriation process, questioning the necessity and reasonableness of doing so.
Where are the boundaries of power and rights under the impact of the new crown epidemic?
A Up master of Station B released a video of "Please don't use the epidemic to 'kidnap' students" to condemn the violent expropriation of student dormitories in colleges and universities, harming students' personal property, causing widespread concern.  Beeps.
In other words, the crux of the problem lies in how to ensure the public interest at the same time, but also to ensure that individual rights and interests are not "mistakenly hurt" by public power. This is often seen as a "degree" issue in Chinese political discourse, but to be precise, we must first identify an inviolable "hard border" or the enforcer will not know where that "degree" is.
Power Game in ForceD Segregation
See the recent record of the Wuhan girl "Guo mi rabbit" on the bean petal. She fell ill at the end of January, her temperature dropped and she dropped, but she burned back from her medication, and she was diagnosed with nucleic acid tests in fear. However, the community every day to make countless phone calls to urge, she was still forced to quarantine, she worried that she was only the common cold, but therefore infected.
On February 13th she complained online: "There is no reason why the average patient is also defined as suspected coronary pneumonia." I don't have a fever, I don't have a cough, my family is healthy and normal. I was never diagnosed, i was forcibly quarantined and kept in a school dormitory with these fever patients. Before the community to take the despicable means of cajoling, in the middle of the night do not let people sleep, toss patients, now know that there is no doctor here no medicine will not give you nucleic acid testing, just locked here, not see the day. My current condition is that since I left home, I can't sleep well and my health is getting worse. I was desperate. "
At the same time, Wuchang Lake Street Tea Port Community Taoshan Village District hundreds of owners jointly reported the neighbor Chen Beiyang, said that the family before and after the Spring Festival, nucleic acid testing has been confirmed to be infected with new coronal pneumonia, but they refused to be admitted to hospital treatment, but on personal relationship after the prescription of drugs, at home isolation. They originally lived in Zhangjiawan District, after the community because of multi-family infection, strict management, people around him are known to him, have been fever-sick family of three from February 4 onwards moved to Taoshan Village to live;
February 12 Wuchang District, the Judicial Office, the community of more than 10 people to persuade four hours, this family only opened the door "receiving", but also put forward at home nucleic acid testing and other unreasonable requirements. After being sealed, they tore it up again. This caused panic in the whole community, the joint request to the family as soon as possible, and even proposed to cancel Chen's deputy office-level treatment, the dismissal of the civil service. The next day, they finally got on the official bus and were picked up at the quarantine point.
These two things have different perspectives, but the approach is similar. At first glance, the most critical difference between the two cases is that the former has not been diagnosed, and the latter is clearly confirmed, but in the actual implementation is "one size fits all"; Although she has long since not had a fever, fever screening is now out of the way, and nucleic acid test results may not be accurate because of possible deviations in the sample.
Where are the boundaries of power and rights under the impact of the new crown epidemic?
The concept of "square cabin hospital" refers to the use of large places to centralize the treatment of patients with mild illness. On February 15, the first 17 patients were discharged from Wuhan Living Room Square Hospital.  Gao Xiang/China News Agency
The trickier part is that in these cases, everyone is primarily concerned that their situation is not taken care of enough, and that being forcibly quarantined can be interpreted as a violation of an individual's rights, but if it is already infected and there is a risk of infecting others, it is no longer a personal matter, but a public matter, at which point the individual will is ineffective. This is also the logical starting point for the residents of Taoshan village district who have jointly written a petition calling for mandatory isolation of patients. That is to say, the "suspect" here itself has a vague lying area, and the implementation of isolation is not a medical professional, but an administrative means, so the definition of public medicine becomes a dispute over whether power crosses the border.
It is worth noting that in the process of being isolated and admitted, ordinary people are community personnel "swindle", soft grinding hard bubble to do work, and in the face of a retired cadres of the Judicial Office, we need to send a higher level, more people to the door, and still failed to force isolation on the spot, so that hundreds of families in the community to book. This is the epitome of the functioning of our society: whether individual rights or powers, based on non-professional opinion or statutory terms, ultimately depend on complex game of thrones.
Where are the boundaries in the public/private sphere?
Wuhan girl "Little Hang" because a family of three infected, desperate when the Internet for help; However, her blood-soaked cries of pain were borrowed from the media author "Also Enthusiasm", rendered and turned into a 100,000-plus online article, and the end of the text "appreciation" of the income did not give her a penny.
Seeing that their pain was being exploited, is double the pain, she asked the other side to respect their right to privacy, will be deleted, many people also condemned this is in the "cannibal blood hoe", but got an arrogant answer: "This hoe I eat." "
Many friends talk about this matter are angry and faint, even Ping-su has always been gentle people said ,"I really have never seen such a shameless person." For shameless people, merely a general moral condemnation of their "shamelessness" is usually not so damaging, but the resulting public pressure can turn such verbal informal sanctions into formal sanctions, such as those imposed by weChat's public platform.
Back to the events themselves, it is not so much a matter of personal morality ("shameless") as a matter of personal rights. The reason for this is that in the internet age, the boundary between personal affairs and public affairs is very blurred. This is somehow close to the situation of entertainment stars: any personal affair they may have been made public or even entertained. This kind of life without privacy space is certainly not comfortable, so Fan Bingbing said: "Million arrow through the heart, habit sits." "
There is a legal concept of "mandatory frankness": citizens have the right to know, i.e. the right to know about matters relating to them. Public figures such as the president are manipulators of state affairs, so they should not enjoy the privacy of ordinary citizens;
For the average person, private matters certainly fall within the scope of privacy, and even online talk may be in this category, but the spread of social media can easily unknowingly cross the line. Like Dr. Li would have been only quietly in the group of relatives and friends to warn everyone to note, the result turned out to be a public event;
Originally, China's social privacy rights have not been established, but now there is a large area of public/private fuzzy. In any event, however, it is not possible to justify his or her tort severance by saying "this is public", and when the person concerned has stated his request for deletion, it has been made clear that he or she feels that his or her rights have been violated, and that respect for his or her privacy rights is the only legitimate way if he is not a "mandatory and honest" public figure (in other words, his or her private affairs do not involve the public interest).
All these examples reveal the same message: the boundary between power and power is still in the midst of a vague and dynamic change, which is not only a game for the generation of the power consciousness awakening, but also tests the governance level and political wisdom of those in power.

One
Locusts!
This commonly known as grasshopper's arthropods, we now see less, however, in a hundred years ago, our grandfather's generation, can talk about locust color change!
Why?
Because, this one foot can kill a bunch of small things, once formed a group, but there is the potential to destroy decay, destroy everything.
The number of locusts per square kilometre can reach 40 million, flying 150 kilometers a day and eating 35,000 people a day.
Locusts like to nibble rice, rice, wheat, corn leaves, where, cover the sky, inch grass do not stay, red land miles, the people's rations are devoured!
Take the 1927 locust plague that swept across the North China Plain like a hurricane, according to an old man who worked as a train driver on the Jiaoji Railway:
That year, locusts were lying on the railway, tired like hills, blocking the way for the train, and the jiaoji railway traffic was interrupted for 72 hours.
Mo Yan's novel "The Locust Talk" is, is described as:
A large number of locusts kept coming. The sky rolled a cloud of furry clouds, countless wings fanned, making a frightening loud noise.
The sky is yellow, the sun is covered, the blood and rain, like the end of the coming. They chewed wildly, the sound of rain in the fields, and the harvest of the harvest disappeared in the blink of an eye.
Locusts are endless, dead locusts pile up in the streets, deep. By the foot of the gingle, black juice splashed, smelly nose, so that most people vomit more than.
This terrible scene, people shudder!
Some people might say, this hundred years ago, you fry this leftover seating why?
Because, in addition to the new corona outbreak, there is now another global disaster spreading, and not far away from us.
There are 400 billion locusts, Zhengbing Chen our border!
Two
The number of locusts has increased 64 million times in a year and a half, and nearly 400 billion locusts have reached the Chinese border!
The United Nations has issued a warning!
On February 11th the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) issued a global warning, saying it wanted the world to be on high alert for the locust plague, which is now raging, to prevent a food crisis in the invading countries.
It is reported that the locust plague began in Africa, and then flew over the Red Sea into Europe and Asia, has now reached Pakistan and India, from China can be said to be only one step away.
The number of locusts in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia is reported to have increased 64 million-fold in a year and a half and now stands at 360 billion.
In the north-east of the country, a swarm of locusts alone is 60 kilometers long and 40 kilometers wide, according to the Kenyan government.
Look, the 360 billion locusts that have come in are frantically devouring crops in East Africa, and wherever they go, the grass is nowhere to be seen.
They line up like dark clouds, flying more than 90 miles a day and eating up thousands of miles of crops along the way.
Each locust is about the size of half a palm.
And such a large locust, dense and flaky on the ground, usually a few hours can eat up all the green vegetation.
East African farmers used wide leaves to drive out locusts and waved umbrellas among the locusts, but they could not stop the disaster.
From FAO statistics, the locust plague on crops damage is the most in East Africa in 25 years, is The most in Kenya 70 years.
Even more frightening, according to the FAO, if the june dry season is not controlled, the number of locusts could increase 500-fold, or 180 trillion.
Oh, my God, 18 million, 000, 000, 000 locusts...
The people of East Africa are alst food-poor, locust plagues will leave tens of millions of people facing a food crisis, these poor people will be fruitless, displaced!
More troublingly, the disaster is spreading, with locusts flying from Africa across the Red Sea into Europe and Asia, and now reaching Pakistan and India, just a stone's throw from China.
Somalia, Pakistan and other countries, has been because of the African locust plague, declared a national state of emergency, in a mode of war against locusts.
At the end of January 2020, Pakistan launched an emergency response to fight locusts in a war situation.
In addition to Pakistan's emergency, locusts have now arrived in India, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has offered to extend an olive branch to Pakistan to request a truce.
No truce, because according to Indian experts predict that the locust plague will cause India to reduce food production by 30-50%. India has the second-largest population in the world after China, with 1.35 billion people.
India and Pakistan are China's neighbors, India and Pakistan suffered from locust plague, locusts are only one step away from China.
With 400 billion locusts on the border, China also needs to do a good job of coping.
Three
1, some people may ask: many years have not heard of locust plague, how suddenly came, but also so large-scale?
The reason is four words: global warming!
As the ancients clouded, drought-stricken and locusts, locusts often accompanied by drought - locusts spawned soil spawning with low moisture content, as was the case in East Africa.
Over the past few years, global warming has caused east African lands to start with a drought and end with floods, making the natural environment extremely degraded and becoming a hotbed of locusts.
Unusual lying rain has left East Africa's long-suffering arid land with a soil moisture content of 10 to 20%.
This is the most suitable condition for locust eggs to hatch, even buried in the ground for half a year several generations of locust eggs, hatched together unearthed.
When the locusts hatch, you have to eat them? Well, due to heavy rainfall, the East African desert vegetation is growing rapidly, and when locusts hatch, they taste good and drink, and the number has doubled 400 times in six months.
But when the larvae grew up, the amount of food increased dramatically, and they ate up the vegetation in the desert, did not have to eat, had to start migrating, flocking to find food.
That's how the locust plague begins!
2. Some one might ask: Is locust not a high-protein grasshopper? Really, Chinese eaters, not minutes to give them to eat extinct?
Locusts can indeed eat, in fact, in the face of locust plague, some countries began to eat locusts.
In the government's powerless Yemen, locusts have become food for people there, said Ahmed, a bug catcher.
"Locusts are a very nutritious food rich in vitamins and protein. As long as the oil simple frying, crispy and crispy with bread are very suitable, simple single meal! "
.
To put it this way, in fact, want to eat locusts to eliminate the super-large locust plague is ridiculous, locusts are not afraid to eat, it is not possible to eat locusts to solve the problem.
The reason is simple, because people can't catch so many locusts until the crops are destroyed.
You know, locusts flock in groups, migrate very fast, don't stay in one place too long, eat dozens of miles a day all the plants are too normal.
In one day, let you catch, how many locusts can you catch?
Can't catch much, don't believe you go to the horse honeycomb will know, the experiment told me you can shoot a few, enough to eat a year.
When the locusts eat up the crops, the famine comes, the locusts don't know where to fly, it is estimated that eight Chengdu has been into the soil, this thing is not long life.
What's more, locusts can also have viruses in their bodies, which, if consumed in large quantities, can cause new infectious diseases.
Really don't take the ancients as fools, if the fried can solve the problem of locust plague, the ancients do not have to a village to starve to death, locusts will not be called the three natural disasters.
3, some people will also say: now the flood of locusts, is the desert locusts, they are not convinced of China's soil and water. What's more, between China and India, across the Himalayas, they can't fly.
It's not good to say.
Indeed, the locust species is the African desert locusts, China has not such a species, in our history has not recorded the African locusts caused significant harm to China.
But, as experts say, it is not clear whether the learning nature of African desert locusts has changed as climate and the environment change.
And, although locusts can't fly through the Himalayas, they can fly around circles, such as around Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, and then into our country.
After all, locusts have reached India and Pakistan;
Such a large scale of locusts if the real arrival, to deal with or quite hard, we still have to be prepared, as far as possible to minimize the loss!
Four
Locusts, fires, viruses, flu...
The magic start of 2020 will make every earth's people can't help but sigh: What's wrong with the world?
Yes, the alarm bells of nature have been sounded, and nature has begun to retaliate against human itys!
You know, the earth is an extremely complex system, each of the above life has evolved over countless years, facing the Earth, human beings are too young.
Once human beings lose their awe of nature, arrogant, and rashly destroy the balance of nature's formation, they will encounter nature's counter-eating.
All this, as Engels points out in Nature Dialectics:
Don't overindulge our human triumph over the natural world. For every such victory, nature retaliated against us, and our initial achievements disappeared.
Ignorance is not an obstacle to survival, arrogance is, no winner after the shooting!
Good people, you should be vigilant!

50. "After the outbreak, the law of survival will be completely changed"

Every time humanbeing experiences a turbulence, it is the process of self-upgrading of the social system, each link is facing a change.
The world is already in the middle of a great change, every major event, can only make change accelerate. The arrival of this epidemic will speed up the elimination of society, but also let innovation speed up the pace.
After this new corona pneumonia, the law of social survival will be completely changed, it has changed the business, life, life of mankind!
1
An accomplished man must be a man who sees through the law.
Everything has a law, all through life, long, harvest, hidden, four processes. Spring seed, summer long, autumn harvest, winter collection, each stage has its own characteristics.
In the stage of the submarine dragon do not use, should be buried hard work;
Why are those who get through the road healthier? Because they are proficient in the logic of the operation of all things in the world, understand that suffering is a part of life, understand that ups and downs is the norm of life, so they can control their own life!
2
Ninety-nine percent of the world's people live in illusions:
The heroes they worship are the heroes of legend, not the heroes of reality;
They have never really longed for truth, they seek neither value nor good product, but emotional comfort.
The "reality" that makes them feel bland will always be deaf to them. On the contrary, legends that make the public feel good about it can make the masses crazy and fascinated.
So if you tell a good story and soothe their hearts, you can be a great success. So the fate of these people is to be harvested.
Only 1% of the world's people live in the truth, these people are the masters of the world!
3
Today's information dissemination is highly developed, and on the face of it, everyone has access to all kinds of information anytime, anywhere. In fact, the more we see everything in an age where everything seems to be visible, the more we can see.
Because what we see is what other people want us to see. In the torrent of information, people's distractions and desires are linked, see all kinds of illusions and delusions.
In this long-running, Zhaozhao-moon society, we are all blind with our eyes open.
Therefore, in the future we must learn how to live in peace with these foolish people.
The core of the future commercial competition is to seize the commanding heights of the "mass mind".
4
The biggest difference between man and man is the difference in cognition.
Every penny you earn is a realization of your perception of the world, and every penny you lose is because your perception of the world is flawed.
You'll never make more money beyond your cognitive range, unless you're out of luck, but money from luck, and often lose on strength, is inevitable.
The greatest fairness of this society is that when a person's wealth is greater than one's own, there are 100 ways in which it harvests you until it matches your perception with its wealth.
Wealth will always flow to the people who best match him, the ones who really occupy the commanding heights of cognition.
The fairest thing about this era is that it continues to discover high-cognitive people, allowing them to control wealth and manage and lead society.
The evolution of human civilization is the continuous upgrading of the management style of "high-cognitive" people to "low-cognitive" people.
To enhance cognition is the fundamental of class attack.
5
Humans are evolving into two species:
The first person is the vast majority of people, they will be algorithmic control, indulge in all kinds of short-lived entertainment, become more and more stupid, not worth;
The second group is a very small number of people who will grow themselves through self-discipline and self-drive, beyond the algorithm, and rely on this spirit of "self-discipline" and "self-drive", they will continue to produce "credit assets", including products/works, etc., will lead the progress of society.
The first person in the eyes of the second, just like ants in our eyes, is transparent, manipulated, completely worth mentioning.
This is the true portrayal of "the world is unkind, to all things for the dog."
Indeed, humanity is polarizing: some want to go to hell, some people go to heaven. A small group of people will evolve into gods for other larger parts.
6
It's not the product that needs it, it's the people that need it in the world.
The future - reliance is more important than intelligence, love is more important than hard work, and ingenuity is more important than hard work.
A piece (product) from 0 to 99% that part can be done by money. But from 99% to 99.9%, to 99.99%, it depends only on one person's love and mentality.
Interest is the core driving force of everyone's growth, and the wealth of a person, like the value of investment goods, is the return of the mean. That mean is your impulse, your love!
The last dividend of China's economy is the "demographic dividend", and the next dividend is the "people's dividend", which inspires everyone's innermost love and interest.
Times are really different, and everyone will be the closest to themselves. What determines where each of us comes home must be our ability and desire to combine ourselves.
The best investment in the future is self-investment, is a deep exploration of the self, and can be more precise positioning.
7
This is no longer the time when you can fix the customer with a few gimmicks;
This is no longer the time when you can handle the girl with sweet words;
This is no longer the time when you can make a meal and drink a drink;
This is an era of "sincereness" over "competence".
This is a "character" is greater than "see" era.
This is an era of "reassuring" greater than "encouraging".
In the age of IQ change, the mind is also the highest investment!
In the confused reality, the really powerful people, often know how to "hold the simple and clumsy", but in a variety of changes, i am afraid of the world highlighted the glory.
Indeed, people return to the truth.
8
The world seems unfair, some people get the power to rush to the sky, some people are talented but buried without a trace. But if we extend the time a little longer and stand a little higher/far the way of the society, we will find that it is really fair.
Because, a person creates value, determines a person's end, the value will eventually return.
Some people first rise and then suppress, some people first suppress and then rise, some people step by step. Life really need not be so anxious, down-to-earth to do their own, the front of less back will naturally make up, here less there will naturally make up, this is called Heaven Road.
Make a summary:
1: A person's reputation can not be greater than talent;
2: A person's wealth can not be greater than merit;
3: A person's status cannot be greater than the contribution;
4: A person's position cannot be greater than the ability.
Otherwise, Germany does not match the position, there will be disaster.
9
Your own hierarchy determines the level you are at. And you can only interact with people at the same level.
Don't go after a horse, with the time to catch the horse to plant grass, until the spring warm flowers bloom, there will be a group of horses you choose;
Instead of spending a lot of time meeting others, focus all your energy on what you should do, get things to the extreme, and raise your level! Naturally, others will be attracted.
The use of people to make a friend is only temporary, with the strength to attract friends is long-term.
So enrich yourself more than to please others.
If you bloom, butterflies come from, if you are wonderful, day by self.
10
Every year, there is a magical "law of courtesy":
What others give you is something you can afford. Those things you can't afford, no one has ever given them to you!
Because when others give you gifts, they will measure your value first, they will only send you those things within your value.
It can also be understood that others will not pay more than your value when they pay for you.
So, if you want to be sent something, you have to be able to afford it yourself.
We must keep this truth in mind: no one will pay for anything other than your value!
11
Success is a shortcut, the biggest illusion in the world.
The so-called "good players all the way to the perfect hand", the real chess people, not by a trick to make enemies, but rather to recruit steady and steady, step by step to win, such a person must be the final winner.
The real master, is to do a stupid and steady person, to do those seemingly very stupid but very stable things, seize the small advantages, small wins for big wins, so that each small victory has become a paving brick to a big victory.
We usually relish to win more / to small big / one trick enemy / success secret, often false, are an illusion.
The real wise man, but always secretly under the "stupid kung fu", only the fool is looking for shortcuts.
The real logic of success is this:
Choose the precise direction, use time to do leverage;
Find a slight advantage and overlay with the effect.
12
In this era, learning seems to be more and more convenient, everyone can access all kinds of knowledge anytime, anywhere. In fact, the more we learn real knowledge in an age when "knowledge" can be trusted.
Because people are blinded by desire, it is not so much that people seem to worship knowledge more and more, but rather a shortcut to success.
The so-called: the deep-minded, not so much what we see is knowledge, but rather we see all kinds of absurdity and paranoia.
Learning is the only fair thing in the world:
You can pay people to read, but you can't pay for you to work hard
You can spend money on other people's time, but you can't spend money to think for you.You can spend money on other people's experiences, but you can't afford to take fewer detours.
13
Why do those very reasonable approaches, which you often use after they are not useful, or even counterproductive?
Because there is no such thing as a way to make sure that everyone can apply it.
No matter how wise a person, they can only give you one revelation at most, and all the truths given by the outside world must combine their own characteristics and resources, and then you form your own methodology.
Whether it's starting a business, investing, socializing, falling in love, getting married, and so on, the best way is to have no fixed method;
If you take other people's experiences and summaries directly to use, basically it's a failure.
This is to ask for people is better than to seek oneself, everyone to success is not the same way.
What really helps you is yourself.
14
The world is really fair, you envy the life behind, often have you can not stand the bitter.
Life is a balance, a tray called "the rich before the people", another tray called "people after suffering."
The two are always balanced: if you want to be noble before, one must suffer later.
A person can only endure what others can not bear, can get what others can not get, only in the humble people can see the truth of the world.
A true hero, a life must go through two stages, the first is adversity, the second is a desperate situation.
Mature in adversity, awakened in the desperate situation, only across the past these two difficult people, is the real hero of the world.
If your life has not experienced such a dark time, not a single quiet struggle of the day, you will never know what the dawn is, do not know the true meaning of life.

The world is a balance:
The richer the material, the more the intelligence of the person will be metamorphosis;
The more scientific and technological, the more empty the human spirit will be;
The more nutritious you are, the weaker your physiological function will be.
The future of society, the pace will be faster and faster, the cycle of change will continue to shorten, all kinds of unpredictable things more and more, our spirit will be in a long time in tension and anxiety.
The biggest challenge to the future of mankind is not artificial intelligence, not an economic crisis, not cancer, but a human mental problem.
In the future, we must have a strong enough heart to meet the changes in the outside world, otherwise there will be mental problems.
Whether a person's heart is healthy or powerful in the future is more important than anything else.
If a person does not know how to repair, only by brute force hard work, become a machine that will only make money, will encounter the demons of the heart, and will even go into the magic.
16
We live in an extremely delicate society, and it takes a great deal of wisdom to get through the logic of being run by society.
The greatest characteristic of this society is that everything must be divided into two opposites of yin and yang, and there are two sets of order to keep it running:
The first set of order hanging in the mouth, is benevolent morality, is floating on the surface, everyone only say not to do, stay in the slogan and mouth, belongs to yang.
The second set of order hidden in the heart, is the interests of gain and loss. Is potential underwater, everyone only do not say, only apply to practical action, belong to yin.
The first set of order is yang, the second set of order is Yin, the two complement each other, who can not be separated from whom.
Can also be so popular understanding: some things can only do can not say, some things can only say can not do.
17
"The theory of the rich" says that the decline in profits is not the result of a decline in business, on the contrary, it is the inevitable result of a business boom.
18
The company's development has gone through three stages:
1: Resources are king
2: Channel is king
3: The user is king
The company's structure has also undergone three phases of change:
The first stage: the relationship between shareholders (unilateral relationship)
Phase 2: Relationship between Shareholders and Employees (Bilateral Relations)
Phase 3: Relationships between Shareholders, Employees, and Users (Multilateral Relationships)
Before, we are operating goods, the future we operate is the user, is the person.
19
China is a continuous shuffle of society, social class is very mobile, feng shui turns, each leading the way for decades, you sing me on stage. It's like a bottle, and once it's going to settle and cure, it's shaken twice.
Whoever stops to enjoy life will be overtaken. So, no matter how many achievements you have, how high your status, you can't choose comfort, you can't stop.
Not allowing a few people to sit and enjoy their success is what makes China special and fairest.
Therefore, since ancient times, China has advocated "struggle to change fate", China's 5000 years of culture can be profiled, that is, "struggle."
Therefore, society will always leave a path of rise for the people of the lower level, as long as you are willing to work hard, there is a chance to climb.
Struggle is the constant theme of Chinese life.
20
The more mature a person is, the more he can find a truth:
In reality, many things, often not black or white / right or wrong;
In reality, many people are often not non-good or evil/non-enemy or friend.
The extreme of the right is wrong, the extreme of the wrong is right; Good and evil are all to follow this logic, the world is not absolute, has been in circulation and transformation!
Therefore, there are really a lot of intelligent people, never simply use "right" and "wrong" to judge things, but in the constant balance of that "degree", "degree" grasp well, the overall situation will not be disorderly.
Gray-degree thinking is the highest state of thinking mode. Grasp the scale, is the most important point of our power.
The test of a person's abilities is to see whether he can have two opposing ideas in his mind at the same time, and maintain his ability to act normally.
21
No matter how society changes, it is inseparable from a big rule:
Human development has a regular, that is: short-term opportunities, medium-term ability to fight, long-term people.
Birth determines your starting point, ability determines how fast you can go, and character determines how far you can go.
The development of enterprises also has a law: short-term marketing, medium-term spelling model, long-term products.
Summary: All human competition, in the final analysis is the "character" and "product" competition.
All the victories of mankind are the triumph of "values"!
This is also called "Heaven".

/*********************************************************************************/

51. "70,000 people diagnosed, hundreds of millions of people banned: the outbreak, gave everyone three signals!" ......》
Qing listens to Qingyuan the day before yesterday
Luxurious event, hotr than the wife and children.
More than a month after the outbreak, a hot search appeared on Weibo: What did you understand during the outbreak?
The following message, the highest praise is:
In addition to life and death, the other is a small matter, the body is the capital of the revolution.
The simplest happiness is to be together in good health and harmony with your family.
Indeed, isolated at home for twenty days, no work, no party, life immediately deserted up, many people found that the original do not take the initiative, really no one remembers.
After this disaster, we see the superficial falsehoods, understand what really matters in life.
This war between humans and viruses has taught us at least three important lessons.
01
Treat health, and treat it and cherish
Nothing is more important than health.
I have read a sentence:
Health is the front 1, without this 1, the back of countless 0s will become meaningless.
After this outbreak, many people feel that if you come back, people must refuse to eat game.
After all, to be healthy is to contribute to the world.
Have you ever seen a scene like this in your life:
In front of the food, the big fast, let the weight continue to soar;
Indulging in parties, eating and drinking, how can not drink a small wine?
All kinds of exotic food, is the identity of the symbol, have to taste
......
After the bitter lesson, people suddenly realized:
The so-called Jinshan Yinshan, but the ordinary day three meals.
Countless luxury events, than the wife and children hot head.
A few months ago, i heard the family say that a big man from a neighbor's house had died on a wine table.
That person I have seen, tall, spirited, character is also very bold, from time to time invited a group of friends gathered in his home, drinking, yin Dashan, not happy.
This day, after full of wine, he intends to lie on the table for a while, who knows but never wake up.
I was surprised and sighed at this news.
A man in his prime, so suddenly left, the family also has a wife and a son who has not yet grown up.
Is such a tragedy really an accident?
Perhaps, his body has long been slightly intact, but not taken seriously;
Perhaps he had felt dizzy when he started drinking, but he did not restrain himself...
The body had a hint, but he didn't take it seriously.
Respect for the body's signals, why not respect life?
Mr. Lu Xun once said, "To make a person's limited life more effective, but also to extend human life." "
This time, let us learn, how to respect life, respect for nature.
Love life, love life, more exercise, less late, eat more healthy food, everything knows how to stop, let oneself live healthy point, to the spirit of charging.
When we treat life, we really want to do and cherish it.
02
Real relationships, not in the middle of a crisscrossing
Wang Yuelun once said in a variety show:
"For adults, it doesn't really make sense to have some kind of crisscrossing.
Because no amount of alcohol is enough to keep you capable of doing things.
If you are strong enough, naturally full of people.
On the contrary, if you can't afford to fight, then even if you participate in more wine bureau, no one will look at you. "
The remark resonated with many people.
"Deep feelings, a mouthful of stuffy", is not the life of many people make friends in the way?
Not long ago read a news, a man after work and colleagues dinner, unknowingly drunk.
Colleagues took him to the door of the community unit building and left.
As a result, instead of going home, he went further and further in the opposite direction, eventually disappearing into the darkness.
The next day, his body was found in the river next to the neighborhood.
It's hard for the men's families to accept, and to find a story with colleagues who drink with him.
But colleagues are also very aggrieved, "we sent him to the door of the community, has been benevolent to the righteous." "
In this matter, it seems that no one is wrong, but the end of all people can not accept.
Colleagues and friends dinner, have to pour themselves drunk like mud to prove their heartfelt?
Is the other person's disrespect for himself if he doesn't drink?
Behind the painful lessons of time and time again, is our interpersonal relationship combing, a reflection.
The 2020 outbreak has left us with fewer opportunities to eat, but we have not felt the loss of anything precious.
On the contrary, home to us, a lot more and children get along, more and love between the company, everything seems so vivid and harmonious.
Friends naturally don't forget each other.
On The second day of the new year, a good friend made a video call on WeChat.
We chatted for a long time, remind each other to pay attention to safety, less out, more homes.
The moment I hung up, I felt deeply that the relationship between people does not have to get together to stay close.
A phone call, it is enough to express your concern and concern, but also let you feel, you in the heart of friends of the weight.
To colleagues and friends from afar, make a phone call, sincere blessing, better than the wine table crisscrossing.
03
At a critical moment, money is a sense of security.
A recruitment website on the Internet has launched a question: If you don't work, how long can you live?
The posts were hot and the discussion was lively.
The results show that most people, if they lose their jobs, are largely out of a month.
This is a flirtatious post, did not think, soon after a word into a phrase.
The disaster of the 2020 Spring Festival has been going on for more than a month.
People are home, but their income has plummeted.
Countless industries have been hit, hotels, restaurants, tourism, film and television, training... almost covering the majority of society.
Friends in a training school as a teacher, affected by the outbreak, the training school all courses suspended, the start of the class time is far away.
Ben had no regular job and lost all her income at once.
And she old open a small company, this on the wind and rain, income instability, this time also directly closed.
The whole family to eat and drink Lazar, mortgage car loan how to do?
She had never been difficult for money before, and this time she was really difficult.
Watching the news, we'll see a lot of people who would rather risk being infected than go out to work.
A takeaway brother in the knowledge that there are few cases of a list, but also to insist on going out to send takeaway, only because to the family to feed the children to buy milk powder.
The world, at this moment, money, for the vast majority of people, has become an unusually precious thing.
So, how do we deal with money on weekdays?
Do you work to make ends meet, have the concept of saving, money, insurance, or think that money is something outside of your body, and do you earn it for your use?
Are you willing to invest in yourself to learn, improve your skills, and develop your potential?
Take advantage of this opportunity, you may wish to comb the relationship with money.
"There is food in the bag, no panic in the heart" is very important to everyone.
In "Say Yes to Wealth":
If you have this view, "I have to sacrifice, I have to struggle, I have to work hard to make a lot of money", you won't see these easy opportunities to make a lot of money.
You'll be like a blind man, you won't see the jewels scattered under your feet, and even if you step on it, you'll kick it away as a stone.
In her wealth class, countless people have a bad relationship with money, and eventually lose themselves in the face of money or temptation, or heavyness.
To comb your relationship with wealth is also to sort out one's own life.
Only by knowing how to respect money and appreciate it can you control your desires and not let money slip away from his fingertips.
Plan to develop a learning path for yourself, the wealth will be reasonable planning, so that their inner full, to maintain a sense of awareness.
In this way, we can walk on another leg when a crisis comes or our lives change.
Like my friend, this training course, though affected, did not affect her to pick up a pen and write a novel she once liked.
Life you and I, we must firmly believe that we have in addition to the current talent, there will be another talent, it lets us independent, determined, can make money is also enough to enjoy the convenience of money.
The epidemic will pass, our lives will always recover a little bit, as that said, everything will be all right.
But I hope that with the outbreak it is only the virus.

52. My Wuhan Diary, I have to gap a semester has been finalized"
Original Meet Wellesley

2020/01/23
At 7 a.m. my father received a call from my cousin, saying that Wuhan's 2 a.m. message would be closed at 10 a.m. today, so let us go with his family to his hometown in Hunan, my father hesitated to agree. I didn't get up, don't know what happened, until 9 o'clock confused wake up, and my father complained about the recent situation is so serious, may not go out, my father said really can't go out, 10 o'clock to seal the city, Wuhan's bus subway high-speed train all stopped, I realised that my father is not joking, I really can't go.
This news came very suddenly, our family did not have a little preparation, at first did not take the city seriously, feel that they are booked international tickets, should not be limited, after all, Beijing 03 SARS when the aircraft high-speed rail did not stop. We take it for granted, the city is serious and comprehensive, I am all morning in the micro-blogging WeChat, found that all today's flights in Wuhan have been cancelled. My flight is tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., there is no news of any flight adjustment, my family is with a glimmer of hope that tomorrow's flight will not be affected.
In the afternoon I finally got through the phone call of China Southern Airlines, said that today all flights in and out of Wuhan have been cancelled, 8 or 9 a.m. notice, tomorrow may still be this time to inform the flight situation tomorrow. I continue to hold a glimmer of hope for further notice.
A message of flight cancellation struck up when you swiped your phone at 8 p.m. Expected and don't want to accept.
The anxiety in our hearts only doubled after the flight was really cancelled. Before was not invited to go to Hunan with my cousin, one is that the situation will not be so serious, the other is the street is full of viruses, once out of the city, then turn high-speed rail or all the way to Shanghai Beijing, and then change the ticket back to the United States. My physical fitness is not very good, poor resistance, my parents are old and old, are 50 or 60 years old people, is vulnerable to infection groups, running outside for so long, extreme fatigue when no disease may also be infected, only finally decided not to rush to join the 299,000 successful escape wuhan people. Now that the flight was really cancelled, the anxiety of going back to school eventually drove our family to start trying to get out of town. My father gave my cousin and Huanggang old home made several phone calls, asked now after the city is still there is no way out of the city, finally decided to drag all the luggage tomorrow to try from Yujialing or Yanglu to Huanggang to Huangshi, and then the river to Jiujiang or Nanchang, my father and my brother flew to accompany me to Beijing or Shanghai. My cousin told us that Huanggang and Huangzhou 12 o'clock will also be completely blocked, do not understand each other, but we are not dead heart, or ready to try. My mother does not come with us, she is very ill, I just returned to China on December 24th that she was cold, played more than ten days to be good, with us to go but make people suspicious. I packed my bags all night, my mother prepared a large package of road supplies, and gave my father a lot of money. I watched the whole family busy, feel really like a flight.
2020/01/24
I heard my dad on the phone before I got up in the morning to ask about the city. After getting up, he told me that several cities around Wuhan, including Huanggang, were sealed dead, could not get out of Wuhan, "escape" plan ran aground. I also did not have a very lost heart, after all, it is only holding the luck to pick up the mentality of missing, stay at home safe and safe is also very good.
I'm jealous of Wellesley's junior sister in Wuhan. Sealed city when she happened to be in Yichang home, today contact her, said that still in Yichang, the ticket has been changed to Beijing, tomorrow, a little worried about Yichang will also be sealed. I advised her to go today, to beijing for a night hotel is also good, lest there be a change.
Another day to China Southern Airlines phone, no one answered, has been busy call, I anxiously want to know whether the booking of the connecting flight can be fully refunded or changed. The New York to Boston period is a United States airline contract, normal operation.
Yesterday to the school email said that can not return to school on time, want to ask the school to retain my student status, this semester courses, and dormitory room. The head of international students and the grade director replied today, said that there is no matter, will help me to inform the teacher and the hangover, but Wellesley as a liberal arts college is not suitable for the network ingress mechanism, if I do not come back two weeks after the start of school must be gap, because the class dropped more can not keep up, self-study can not make up.
Two other international students who were also stranded in Wuhan were contacted on Weibo, one school has yet to respond, and one school has asked for the latest 1.31 to arrive. I feel like I'm luckier than them, at least I have a two-week buffer.
My father since this morning found that wuhan is very calm, every day you travel to watch a long time of television, said a week and two weeks is the time node, a week after the holiday is finished, we all have to go back to school work, Wuhan will certainly open the city, or after two weeks, after a full incubation period, the people with problems will be exposed, The rest is safe and able to get out of town. Many weChat friends know that I can not return to school on time after also comforted me that the city will certainly not be too long, I slowly optimistic up, joking that a week after not opening the city we will break out.
In the evening, I ate the first Chinese New Year's Eve meal with my parents in three years, and watched the first Spring Festival Evening in three years. Feel very funny, originally set in the Chinese New Year's Eve night to go feel a pity, to go on the plane for the New Year, than the students walked earlier, did not expect me to become the only person to stay for the New Year.
Watching the Spring Festival Evening is responsible for the donation of items in the surrounding cities of Wuhan WeChat group ring non-stop. The gods at the schools debated how to devise a route that would deliver supplies from North America to Huanggang Hospital. The news updated very quickly, I looked for half a day did not see what the problem is, directly asked one of the organizers, the same wellesley freshman Carrie, my uncle in Huanggang truck can help the material transport, the group said to want to know all kinds of sealed after the material can be smoothly sent to Huanggang. Later my mother helped to contact a government leader in Huanggang, a former student of my mother, I helped him and Carrie connect. The final group discussion resulted in the Huanggang government's red-headed document approval material to come in, the leadership said to ensure that the document will be approved immediately, not long waiting. I was very happy to see that progress could progress gradually and smoothly. I am trapped in Wuhan home can not go out, but also energy to make some contributions to society, feel that they are quite capable.
Every day will see a lot of doctors and nurses fighting in the front line of the news, today saw a doctor's friend circle screenshots, the entire hospital medical staff has not come home for several days, no network, today a day without food, tomorrow will be no mask and protective take. Now Wuhan and even Hubei hospitals are overcrowded, there are not enough beds, patients run to the hospital to receive patients, the national diagnosis of nearly 900 people, more than 15,000 suspected patients. The safety and mobility of the white-clad angels in the world's support for Wuhan's illness is the only way to divert my attention from my own situation.
2020/01/29
These days every day to send a lot of information mail, with the professor to confirm the details of remote follow-up, please students to help me sign in. I still have two classes hanging on the waitlist, can't enter the word of the class table do not know how to row, the house leak is overnight rain, go back may also have to experience even four lessons lunch did not have to eat sour.
Received a reply from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said that i regret that Chinese citizens can not take a charter flight to leave, can not help me, the only way back is also broken. Although the international department of the school has helped me to send the embassy a request document, but I think it may not be useful.
My father called the mayor's hotline and asked if the government could treat my special circumstances and let me go back to school. The mayor's hotline was pushed to the overseas Chinese office, the overseas Chinese office said that only responsible for foreign citizens pushed to the Hubei provincial government network, the government network and pushed back the mayor's hotline, my father was pushed back and forth all anxious, directly on the phone to question the government why so inaction, no department in the people in trouble willing to come out to take responsibility to help solve the problem. I just read an article earlier, the author called Wei, the mother was first infected, the whole family out can not find a bed, Yan called a lot of mayor hotline, the response only said will reflect to the above, but belatedly did not act, the mother of the dragonfly after a long time was arranged to be admitted to the hospital. What did it feel like to me, the gun was sharp, but poked on a patch of loose sand.
2020/02/10
My mother day and night looking forward to, in the community ordered food finally came back, the school late wages today also came to account. My mother breathed a sigh of relief, afraid that the school was too poor to pay. Think of my father these days also with the company to discuss how to deal with the wages of employees during the outbreak, the enterprise must pay employees on time, no performance and have to maintain capital turnover, can only be a large area of layoffs, some people lost their jobs, some people are looking for a job and there are no large number of jobs open.
2020/02/11
The grade director has no room for a turn, insists that I decide to gap now. In fact, what choice, she heart to help me set up only wait for me to open it. Had to reluctantly promise to gap, a while to contact the professors to inform me of the decision, only to do a good note and homework is now also waste paper.
The teacher at Career Education and I were on a video call to help me plan what I could do during the gap. I can't help crying when I'm in a video, and there's someone who remembers me when I'm in trouble, willing to help me, thank you very much.
I must look forward. Even if you can't stand the sadness and loneliness, but also in the limited space to learn the extreme.
Valentine's Day is my birthday, the first time in three years at home for the New Year's birthday is this ghostly look, even go out to buy a birthday cake are afraid.
Experts say the inflection point of the outbreak has emerged, adding that the incubation period can be up to 24 days. Wuhan is about to open the city, people who need to enter the city are applying. Unfortunately, these news will not bring me any turning point, it has nothing to do with me.

Their lives are always at an end. Some people are not diagnosed, a wisp of smoke disappeared.
Who are they?
Incarnated as a death figure, string into a chain of history, but most of their stories are not recorded, unknowable.
But there are some people, in different fields, have left a deep mark on this society, like stars scattered the light, until the new crown pneumonia took its life, and the dark fade.
Looking back at their stories, they also share a collective memory of the 1,772 lives lost in the outbreak.
【1】
Yang Xiaobo:
The Yangtze River Dream Is Broken
On January 25th, on New Year's Day, Yang Xiaobo was admitted to Hubei Provincial People's Hospital with pneumonia.
Without identification, 57-year-old Yang Xiaobo is the chairman of an insurance company that has been at the helm of Changjiang Financial Insurance for six years. He is better known for his old role as the former mayor of Yellowstone than in this title.
The 40-year-old served as the director of the Zhongnan Architectural Design Institute, ranked at the official office level, 44-year-old cross-border as hubei province construction department director, party secretary, then Yang Xiaobo's future is uncertain. In the winter of 2008, Yang Xiaobo, 45, was transferred to the post of deputy secretary of the Yellowstone Municipal Committee.
A person familiar with Yang Xiaobo in Yang Xiaobo's death under the article left a message, evaluation of his low-key, down-to-earth, in Yellowstone to focus on changing the city's image, thinking ahead of time, "years later, Yellowstone talent gradually realized that his contribution to the development of Yellowstone is irreplaceable."
"He wanted to do a career in Yellowstone, sleeping only four or five hours or even two or three hours a day, spinning around every day, especially tired. "A person who had been in a relationship with Yang Xiaobo for many years recalled. After the news of Yang Xiaobo's death came out, many netizens expressed their nostalgia and regret.
Years of high-intensity work, for Yang Xiaobo's health buried hidden dangers. In 2014, also in the winter, Yang Xiaobo chose to return to Wuhan to become chairman of Changjiang Financial Insurance.
On New Year's Day this year, Yang Xiaobo said in his New Year's message that the new year should "restore growth, significantly reduce losses, promote high-quality development, not in the fantasy, not in vain", calling on employees to "not forget the first intention to start again." And to "the day has unpredictable clouds, E has the Yangtze River financial insurance" end.
This winter, however, Yang Xiaobo did not escape the outbreak of the unpredictable attack, his life with just opened the target, forever stopped on January 27, 2020.

Yu Guanrong:
The Yangtze River has since lost one rescuer.
Yu Guanrong always said that saving people is a "very normal thing", he has carried out this statement for most of his life, are saving people.
The Yangtze River is his "home" to save people, where the slope of the embankment more than 30 degrees, where the moss is the thickest and most slippery, where the steps are hollowed out by the river, he knows. He also called the 50-meter "triangle" of the Yellow Crane Tower Pier the most dangerous place in Wuhan's waters, where he and his companions saved 24 lives in 2014.
Yu Guanrong's work photo in the Yangtze River Rescue Team
In 2005, Yu Guanrong's 23-year-old son was accidentally electrocuted. In order to relieve the pain, in a few years, Yu Guanrong in the persistence of winter swimming at the same time, climbing a number of more than 7000 meters above sea level peaks. After climbing Mount Everest in 2010, Yu Guanrong realized that he still had a lot of work to do.
In the same year, Yu Guanrong founded the Wuhan Yangtze River Rescue Volunteer Team, which has since saved more than 700 lives. For him, every life saved is saving a family. His goal is to "minimize the number of family tragedies in cities that have died from drowning".
Prior to 2010, there were more than 100 drowning accidents per year in Wuhan. Between 2010 and 2013, that number dropped to about 60 a year, and in 2014, the number of drownings fell to more than 20.
Yu Guanrong's wateriness is very good, can be underwater for 3 minutes and 20 seconds. But at 9.30 am on February 6th, he did not breathe his breath and the 71-year-old died of pneumonia.
Two days before his death, Yu Guanrong had told his old companion, Wang Tianrong, on the phone to take good care of himself and remember to sprinkle his ashes in the river outside the Dragon Temple. It is located at the confluence of the Han River and the Yangtze River, where he used to swim and save many lives.
After Yu Guanrong left, the old companion Wang Tianrong is very sad: "He saved a lifetime of people, and finally he needs to be rescued, even relatives have no way." "

Segment Zhengcheng:
Master Fall
In the Chinese University of Science and Technology Mechanical College spread such a saying: not last edgy or five years, it is difficult to graduate from the Doctor.
The tutor is a student of Duan Zhengcheng, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a professor of mechanical science and engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
Picture 1.png
"I'm picky, and I have to read at least three times for each doctoral student's thesis. But close it again! Duan Zhengcheng academician laughs, some disciples because the paper can not pass, no less in front of him crying nose.
Duan Zhengcheng academician is not only strict requirements for students, but also their own physical strength. Duan Zhengcheng and his team have won three second prizes for national scientific and technological progress, none of which have been less than 10 years: the development of a full-body gamma knife, 10 years; He developed gamma knives for cancer treatment, benefiting more than a million people.
Duan Zhengcheng was 75 years old when he was elected a member of the Academy. Outsiders only know that he first declared the Academy of Engineering on a one-time pass, in fact, insiders know that his achievements can already declare academicians.
At the 2012 Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Awards Conference, 78-year-old Duan Zhengcheng was white-haired, straight and hard, becoming the focus of the whole field. After the meeting, he refused media interviews, will be 1 million yuan of the individual part of the donation will be donated to support poor college students.
Duan Zhengcheng had told students, do scientific research to withstand loneliness, can not come outside a "pulse", they will be "shocked." At the end of 2018, the retirement procedures were completed, and the academicians of Duan Zhengcheng were still working on the front line. Yet this persistence was broken not long ago.
On January 29, 2020, Academician Duan Zhengcheng was diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, just last night, medical treatment was ineffective, unfortunately died.
In just a few days, this is the third professor lost to new coronary pneumonia at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
On February 8, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, three-level professor, doctoral tutor, Chutian scholar (special professor) Hong Ling unfortunately died on February 7 at about 23 o'clock due to a new coronavirus infection, treatment invalid at Concord Hospital, aged 54.
On February 10, Professor Colin Zhengbin, an organ transplant at Tongji Hospital affiliated with Huazhong University of Science and Technology, died at the age of 62 after failing to save new coronary pneumonia.
In 1953, The Academician Duan Zhengcheng planted a French dragonfly on campus. After more than sixty years of baptism of wind and rain, the small saplings have now grown into a towering tree.
These masters are like the big trees that are still standing, and though they are gone, the glory is still there.

57. Some people are beginning to swell themselves
Recently, a video of a family of three playing mahjong was reported, circulating on the Internet.
In the video, a family of three is sitting around a table, its music meltplaying mahjong, suddenly rushed into a raging "red armband", two words do not say pick up the table mahjong fell.
A young man who was playing mahjong was instantly enraged, stood up and picked up the mahjong and smashed it past, only to rush in more "red armbands" and control the family of three.
In the face of the "red armbands" of the wrath, the young man asked, a family to eat also want to be isolated? Unsurprisingly, the remark infuriated them even more. The boys were dragged outside by these people to slap, mahjong tables were thrown outside and smashed to smash ...
After watching this video, many people, including me, were angry.
There is no crowd gathering outside without wearing a mask, not only Zhong Nanshan said so, CCTV also said, the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention's mask guide has a similar statement. However, he was eventually severely punished, according to the Jiangxi Fengcheng Municipal Committee Propaganda Department, the teacher was sent to a mandatory isolation point of isolation, and subject to administrative punishment.
Forced isolation means that a person's personal freedom is denied, and why should the teacher be treated with out-of-heart without risk of illness or infection? This to change in peacetime, how strange, how bad a thing. But in the present moment,
In some places, similar extremes have become so justified and unbridled.
The erosion and deprivation of individual rights has reached a frightening point.
It has to be acknowledged that in order to contain the spread of the epidemic, people sometimes have to obey certain temporary controls at the expense of their private rights, but such sacrifices should not be unlimited and the relevant statutory procedures must be followed.
Even we can even say that the more very period, the more to emphasize the law, epidemic prevention and control, is not a free violation of the legitimate rights of the public to shield. Similar to rushinto into private homes to smash the practice, is not what "epidemic prevention", but the epidemic prevention and control of low-level black.
In the face of another big crisis, the bottom line of the rule of law must be kept. It should be noted that in the absence of any restrictions, even if only sesame power, may become a tooth-dancing claws of the monster.
Some grass-roots chaos, in fact, is a wake-up call!
The erosion and deprivation of individual rights has reached a frightening point.

58. On this day, the Wuhan girl was orphaned
Original Fat Master, Three Princes

Tour Band - The Band's Summer No.
Gui Wei, 95, female, residents of The District of Lukou, Wuhan City.
She lives with her mother after her father's death in 2008.
On 3 February, at 6:51 a.m., she contacted the Outbreak Command (weChat) of the Lukou District again:
"My mother has a fever of more than 39 degrees, please get a bed. "
At this point, the mother has a fever for 4 days, breathing difficulties, dangerous.
The test results are delayed, the hospital has no beds, isolation at home is equivalent to waiting for death.
At 8:49 a.m., the staff finally responded:
"Yesterday the emergency newspaper went up, when did his (mother's) examination results come out?" "
Gui Yu hui: "No, it's going to be another day." "
Public help picture from Guiyu Weibo.skryo
The mother, Luo Xianmin, 49, was diagnosed with a lung infection on January 30 at the Gutian San road hospital in the Lukou district. 38 degrees of fever.
Gui Yu reported to the community, the community said to arrange beds to wait for notice.
The mother and daughter had to go home.
On February 1st, my mother's body was really unable to carry it.
She reported to the community again.
The community asked her to hit 120.
Two or three children, the ambulance finally came, Luo Xianmin alone to Hanyang Caidian Tongji Hospital.
Because of fear of infection, daughter Gui Yu can not accompany, can only wait anxiously.
This thought that the mother sent to the hospital can finally breathe a sigh of relief, who knows the next 24 hours, the mother in the hospital in addition to a simple injection, did a nucleic acid test, no one asked.
The patient with a high fever, difficulty breathing lung infection, so a person was left in the hospital corridor, no food, no drink, can not get a rest.
During her time in the hospital she saw, heard not to bear to talk to her daughter, only to say to her: "There is hell."
Public help picture from Guiyu Weibo.skryo
Mother really can't help but let Gui Rong take her home.
After returning home, the mother, afraid of infection to her daughter, insisted on a person to live at home.
She sent a weed to Gui Wei said: "I, they love to deal with the treatment, I have been very sorry for you, mother begs you to fight for your own chance to live." "
Public help picture from Guiyu Weibo.skryo
One day on February 2nd, Gui Wast hard and had been in contact with the community and the outbreak headquarters in the Lukou District.
The nucleic acid test results on the hospital side also changed from 24 hours to 3 days from the beginning.
The community is not arranged, the command does not arrange, the hospital does not arrange.
All said wait for the news.
At 8:30 a.m. on February 3, her mother said she was hungry and wanted to eat porridge.
After Gui Yu bought it, her mother said to put things outside the door, so let her go quickly.
A door, separated mother and daughter, separated from the world's most intense flesh and blood affection.
After the daughter left, continue to contact the parties.
At 9:30 in the morning, she called and her mother kept not answering.
She panicked and worried that the worst result would happen.
She had no keys and had to find the community to unlock them.
More than an hour later, the people in the community came to lock up.
The moment the door was pushed open, Gui Yu burst into tears.
Mother fell in a pool of blood, cut her wrists, grasp the chest, pain.
This human tragedy happened in front of a post-95 girl.
Guiyu has no time to crash.
She immediately called 120. 120 said there was no car to come.She called 119 again. 119 say the new crown thing they don't care about, and let her contact 120.
Gui Yu can only play 110 in the end. The other side asked her if someone had died, not dead looking for 120.
Public help picture from Guiyu Weibo.skryo
Four hours later, 110 came.
That's right, it's four hours.
The medical examiner determined that her mother died of respiratory failure and that her choice to cut her wristwas was the last pain she could not bear.
Gui yu still doesn't have time to crash.
A person has died and a death certificate is required to proceed.
As a result, forensics are pushed to the community, and the community is pushed to the forensics.
After waiting for more than a dozen hours, she finally found a community hospital to issue a death certificate.
Then there was a dozen hours of waiting, and the funeral home's car came.
Public help picture from Guiyu Weibo.skryo
Twelve years ago, in a car accident, Gui Wei sent his father away;
Twelve years later, after a bout of pneumonia, Gui Wei sent his mother away.
She is now an orphan.
Mother finally pain to cut the wrist, this had to endure how much torture, she even forced to endure, before her death in the mobile phone memo, wrote a paragraph to Gui Yu's last words:
"I hope you can get through, live well later, don't be good high and far, plain is the real ... Good to find a good person to you married, a good marriage is not perfect, he loves you on the line. Don't raise small animals in the future, take good care of yourself. "
Finally, she said: "My body would not have been good, I also worry about the burden of yours, and try to save money later." So I really left, I don't regret, the only regret is not to see you get married and this time with the virus guilt. "
Public help picture from Guiyu Weibo.skryo
After his mother's death, Gui wei received the results of the hospital's nucleic acid monitoring.
The text message coldly wrote a large paragraph:
"Ro Xianmin, you tested positive for the new coronavirus pneumonia nucleic acid at Tongji Hospital on February 3, 2020. If you need a paper report, go to the hospital area to print it yourself. "
The person who texted must not know that the patient no longer needs the identification results.
Yesterday (February 16), Gui Wei published these facts on Weibo.
She's been blocked by Weibo, and she's been sending it.
She asked for only one statement.
She said: "I ask the people's government to contact me, thank you, I promise that all what has been said is true, and tell everything! ! "
Through the power of netizens, today (February 17) the relevant departments contactguire.
She tweeted at noon thanking everyone.
One of the most liked messages is written very simply.
Five words:
"Protect yourself." "
This is probably our best wishes for this Wuhan girl.
The outbreak broke out so many days, thought the tears had dried up, but this matter let me tears again.
It was early February, and today (February 17th) I wrote that it was not a panic- attempt, but rather a way for more people to remember what exactly is behind a string of infected numbers.
What has Wuhan, a heroic city, suffered?
One family, one individual, they should have been safe and well into the spring of 2020.
They should have eaten hot dry noodles, they should have waited until "Celebration 2" began.
Gui Weibo I will continue to pay attention to until the problem is solved.
At this moment, no one is an island, we are all China, all mankind.

59. "The outbreak has exposed the fact that too few people can think deeply"
IATF16949 Service Platform 6 days ago

IATF16949 Service Platform
Automotive Industry Knowledge Library
These days it feels like living in an endless Mobius belt, with truthand and lies constantly unfolding.
A mask, can not be used twice, each expert holding a different statement reversed several times.
A rumor that the deceased patient had been left untreated in hospital was reported to have been beaten in the face the next day.
......
The explosive message - the rumor - another message - and the disinformation.
Heartbeats and the brain also passively follow these voluminous messages, and the usual ability to think seems completely blocked.
In such impetuous, fearful, sad environment, the birth of a thousand strange magic news.
Grab double yellow company (some people did not see, directly robbed the beast)
Preventing new coronaviruses by drinking child urine and high alcohol
American Conspiracy Theories
......
Now, are you aware of a problem?
With the further upgrading of Internet big data and algorithms, our access to information becomes wider, which also leads to over-the-top amount of information in daily contact.
We seem to be wandering in a river full of information and data, the river more and more water, more and more rapid, the eyes are about to suffocate.
The brain is struggling to receive all the information, let alone prove it. What kind of situation did it turn out to be?
Your "cognition" depends on the current news reversal to which step, and your "attitude" depends on the largeR V/public traffic who is greater.
The result is that the human cloud is also clouded and can't think deeply.
There are three levels of thinking.
Three stages of the level of thinking -
Level 1: low-level thinking, not good at reflection, relying only on intuition and experience.
Level 2: middle-level thinking, selective to reflection, high skill level, but lack of critical thinking.
Level 3: high-level thinking, with clear thinking ability, often use critical thinking tools.
Thinking is very energy-consuming. Our brains "get used to" a lot of things in order to reduce their workload, so that they don't have to think about it and become "accustomed". In order to reduce the amount of brain work, we can easily trust authority.
Without deliberately training deep thinking, we will stay in low-level thinking.
What impact does low-level thinking have on life?
1. Easy to be brainwashed
When you go to get some common sense of life, it may be convenient to retrieve information, but what about a specific thing?
The elderly/students in the family are easily brainwashed by the news of WeChat group - "Quickly escape, a city airborne more than 1000 patients", "confirmed also do not go to the hospital, this disease is completely dependent on immunity, doctors useless."
In this age of letting the news fly for a while, can you clearly judge right and wrong, rather than acting in a hurry?
2. Easy to disrupt your plans
Too often, we are disturbed by gossip about social discourse, both in our mental state and in our behaviour.
In fact, the outbreak has not put any restrictions on you except that you have to stay at home. Assuming you were going to study/jump/turn, this is a very ideal learning period.
But if the goal is called into question because of some negative views and comments, it will eventually upset the plan.
3. Easy to be distracted
It's not hard to understand that the lack of deep thinking can shift the information cloud's attention from the important things to the inconsequential, reducing the depth and breadth of thought, and ultimately nothing can be done.
How to learn to think deeply?
Deep thinking has 3 characteristics -
Observations: Focus not only on the direct consequences of a decision, but also on the impact it may have over time.
Expand your thinking: Think more about perspectives and stakeholders to solve problems from multiple vantage points.
Questioning spirit: Willing to challenge our blind spots, deep-rooted assumptions, and fixed beliefs.
Imagine you can wear an inverted pair of glasses and see the world from a completely different perspective.
On the one hand, you will see the world from a new perspective;
Here are 2 tips to help you develop a habit of deep thinking -
I. Cultivating a sense of deep thinking
Second, cultivate the habit of deep thinking
Cultivate a sense of deep thinking
1. Inquiries
When we try to answer a question, do we simply answer the question "How do we understand it?" "
But there are some deeper problems that we have overlooked.
For example, imagine a scene, and now you see a story on the site.
Low-level thinking people can only think to the first step: "Oh my God, this news said XXX, really terrible." "
A middle-class thinker will ask, "Does this news have a source of information marked?" Then look for the answer: "Where does this source of information come from?" Who reported it? Official? Professional? "
But the problem continues...
"Is this news relevant to our lives?" Is there a warning meaning? "
"What social factors might be behind the news?" "
It seems that we have started a never-ending inquiry. In fact, at no time can we really reach the other end of the problem.
2. Focus
To learn to think deeply, you must focus on your problems. This process can be divided into two steps -
The first step is to eliminate interference
First, it's important to create the right environment - it's important to find a quiet and comfortable place; second, turn off your phone - to prevent you from being disturbed by outside information.
Step 2, increase attention
This is the most difficult point - to focus on a single subject. If you don't consciously decide to keep thinking about it, it's less than 10 seconds and it will turn your attention to something else.
3. Criticism
Critical thinking consists of two things - questioning and seeking truth , so that you don't embrace other people's points of view without thinking , but you can develop your critical thinking in two ways .
First, constantly question your point of view.
It's dangerous to read the work of those who agree with you and surround yourself with vinono. You end up falling into the trap of collective thinking and believing that you are absolutely right.
You need to get your mind out of the "comfort zone" and question your analysis - "Am I really right?" "Is it possible that I would be wrong? "
Second, regular meetings with people who think differently
For the same problem, people of different professions and ages may have different ideas, perhaps in a brain attack, you can deepen your understanding of something.
Cultivate the habit of deep thinking
1. Choose valuable content
Have you ever heard of the famous Tittytainment strategy? Synthesis by Titty (pacifier) and Entertainment, Chinese translates into a nipple strategy.
The milk-head strategy, specifically through the venting/satisfaction industry, allows the public to vent excess energy, or indulge in comfort, thereby losing the ability to advance and deep thinking.
Before the outbreak, stars, gossip, variety always occupy the hot search.
After the outbreak, all kinds of epidemic information in the circle of friends crazy output.
Even this information, 99% of which is of anything, does not help us with any practicality. But most readers don't care about logic, they're stuck in high-pitched emotions.
Once you get used to this low-cost, high-return stimulus, it's hard to do the high-investment stuff.
In daily life, try to set aside a certain amount of time to read deep, excellent books and articles, reject those who deliberately stir up your emotions of the media, maintain the habit of thinking.
2. Learn fresh knowledge and skills
Reluctant to think deeply can bring short-term pleasure, but in the long run, it can only be empty and boring.
The only way to get rid of this hollowness of the mind and the superficiality of thinking is to learn. With each acquire of a new knowledge and skills, that sense of accomplishment is comparable to any entertainment stimulus.
If you haven't really done anything for your own growth for a long time, learn the knowledge and skills that will enhance your worth.
Its meaning is to help you fight the tasteless daily life. Keep you awake.
Have you ever heard of the brain in the tank?
Unable to think deeply, it will be wrapped in the Internet-compiled "twisted" and become a line-up doll.
To break free of the framework of your mind, you need to learn to think deeply -
1. Awareness:
Ask
Focus
Criticism
2. Method:
Choose valuable content
Learn new knowledge

60. "The real data of scare, but also better than the warm man's data"
Original handsome sixgod six god Lei Lei read Jin Yong 1 week ago
Wen/Six God LeiLei
Up this morning, a number of data is a bit scary: 14,840 new cases in Hubei, including 13436 in Wuhan.
More, really much. Because as of the 11th, Wuhan cumulatively reported cases are also "but" is 19558 cases. By the end of the day, it had almost doubled the number of "new" additions. If you look at the data, it is really "viewers like mountain frustration", a day, the epidemic out of control, the virus leap forward, the day spread tens of thousands of people, this battle we can not win.
But what about these huge new data? Take a closer look, basically is "clinically diagnosed cases." For example, 14840 new cases in Hubei, clinically diagnosed cases are 13332 cases, accounting for an absolute large number.
What are "clinically diagnosed cases"? A closer look at the relevant interpretation, consulted professionals, in a sense, pay attention to what I said is a sense, basically is the past has been not counted in the case, missing the case.
For example, a citizen Zhao Qiansun, a fever cough, went to the hospital to check. Also did CT, but also found out the glass-shaped shadow, the new coronary virus infection of the typical symptoms of pneumonia he almost all have, the doctor sighed that you are mostly.
But because of various reasons, such as no reagent box, is not to give Zhao Qiansun diagnosis. The doctor knew he was, and he knew he was, but he was unconfirmed. He can't count a case without a diagnosis, and the data won't be counted. Tomorrow the whole country look at the case data, there is no Zhao Qiansun.
This is not the problem of not receiving treatment, there are no beds, but the old Zhao he does not even count cases. When he looked back, He was not a serious case; The data released every day has nothing to do with Lao Zhao.
Before Hubei, Wuhan informed the number of people, there are many Zhao Qiansun did not count in. Does it make sense to be more realistic? It also makes sense, because it's undiagnosed! Medical matters must be strict, not diagnosed how to count?
But does it reflect the reality? Does not reflect. Does it reflect a real outbreak? Does not reflect. To tell you the truth, I didn't think much of Hubei's data before. Thousands of Zhao Qiansun statistics do not go in, that data is only a confirmed game, this data looked at what?
But now, this part of the vast crowd is counted, the doctor said they are, they are.
A day to add more than 10,000, on the one hand should be because of the recent investigation, should be collected and so on, the suspected cases found out a lot, this work is very hard, the community, grass-roots, the first line especially hard. On the other hand, the statistical caliber has also changed, the previous lying Zhao Qiansun are counted in, so the number has increased significantly.
What is it? That's what's real. Someone always asks: old criticism of the official, what is your appeal? I say the appeal is to hope that they are realistic.
Scary real data, better than warm people's data. Notice that I'm not saying false data, I'm talking about data, it's a mole. The data is misleading, the data leads to the analysis of the dragonfly, resulting in the optimism, paste the window not to say that the rain is small. Some people on the basis of the data to do analysis, alas today a few less ah, "two consecutive drop" "three consecutive drop" ah, indicating that the momentum is very good ah. For example, the following analysis, what is the point?
Now put out the real things, you see, the situation is such a situation, the problem is such a problem, our task is still very difficult, infected citizens are still a lot, not yet bragging time. That's a good thing, better than playing a numbers game.
I know the system better. To make this decision, to put the data into it and to publish it, is also to be taken up. Why is the relevant parties specifically engaged in a "expert interpretation of what is a clinical diagnosis of cases", supporting the issue together? Is afraid of the public can not understand, afraid of public guessing, afraid that the public feel bad outbreak can not control. But the experts reinterpret, but also not understand the data, but also by the punch in the face. It's not easy. Want to borrow a previous article's title said: Please cover your face, adhere to the courage to seek truth from facts.
It's always hard to be realistic. Why is it hard? To tell you is not mainly a matter of the personal quality of officialcadres, but because of the whole body. When you are realistic today, you will appear to be unrealistic in the past, if your department is realistic, it will appear that other departments are not realistic, and if you are seeking truth from facts, you will appear to be untruthful.
For example, the number of people killed by old cattle in your village every year is reported to be one person every year. This year you when the village chief, special want to be realistic, reported is 5 people, that the past data do? How do the sudden surge of four people explain? Villagers say that either the past village chiefs are bad, all deceive us, otherwise you have no skill, did not put the village cattle good. So it is difficult to seek truth from facts and courage to seek truth from facts. The poet Bao Zhao said, since the ancient sages are poor, not to mention my generation alone and straight. To be realistic, you have to be "lonely and straight".
Finally, I say that this data is a good thing, that is for the fight against the epidemic, for the public to know.
For each of these more than 10,000 patients, they are probably facing the mountain-like heavy, early, celebration is still early. Without their sincere permission, we have no right to add words such as good ness and warmth to them. "There is Zhou Wei if the feeding, the dark cold poison in Zhang mowing smile flowering" such things, really do not want to see.
